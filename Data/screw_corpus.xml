The '''ISO metric screw threads''' are the worldwide most commonly used type of general-purpose [[screw thread]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/687806/ISO_TC_001__Screws_.pdf?nodeid=4938938&amp;vernum=0 ISO/TC/ 1 Business Plan], 2007-03-05, Version 1.3. Table 3: The market share of each screw thread, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the first [[international standard]]s agreed when the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) was set up in 1947.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The "M" designation for metric screws indicates the nominal outer diameter of the screw, in millimeters (e.g., an M6 screw has a nominal outer diameter of 6 millimeters).

==Basic profile==
[[Image:ISO and UTS Thread Dimensions.svg|thumb|right|400px|Basic profile of all ISO metric screw threads]]

The design principles of ISO general-purpose metric screw threads ("M" series threads) are defined in international standard ISO 68-1.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title=ISO 68-1:1998 ISO general purpose screw threads – Basic profile – Part 1: Metric screw threads
 | publisher=International Organization for Standardization
 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=3707
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each thread is characterized by its [[Screw thread#Diameters|major diameter]], ''D'' (''D''&lt;sub&gt;maj&lt;/sub&gt; in the diagram), and its [[Thread pitch|pitch]], ''P''. ISO metric threads consist of a symmetric V-shaped thread. In the plane of the thread axis, the flanks of the V have an angle of 60° to each other. The thread depth is 0.614 × pitch. The outermost {{frac|1|8}} and the innermost {{frac|1|4}} of the height ''H'' of the V-shape are cut off from the profile.

The relationship between the height ''H'' and the pitch ''P'' is found using the following equation where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is half the included angle of the thread, in this case 30 degrees:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H  = \frac {1}{2\tan\theta} \cdot P = \frac {\sqrt 3}{2}\cdot P \approx 0.866 \cdot P&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;P  = 2\tan\theta\cdot H = \frac{2}{\sqrt 3} \cdot H \approx 1.155 \cdot H&lt;/math&gt;

In an external (male) thread (e.g., on a bolt), the major diameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;maj&lt;/sub&gt; and the minor diameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; define ''maximum'' dimensions of the thread. This means that the external thread must end flat at ''D''&lt;sub&gt;maj&lt;/sub&gt;, but can be rounded out below the minor diameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, in an internal (female) thread (e.g., in a nut), the major and minor diameters are ''minimum'' dimensions; therefore the thread profile must end flat at ''D''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; but may be rounded out beyond ''D''&lt;sub&gt;maj&lt;/sub&gt;.

The minor diameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and effective pitch diameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; are derived from the major diameter and pitch as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  D_\text{min} &amp;= D_\text{maj} - 2\cdot\frac58\cdot H = D_\text{maj} - \frac{ 5 {\sqrt 3}}{8}\cdot P \approx D_\text{maj} - 1.082532 \cdot P \\
    D_\text{p} &amp;= D_\text{maj} - 2\cdot\frac38\cdot H = D_\text{maj} - \frac{ 3 {\sqrt 3}}{8}\cdot P \approx D_\text{maj} - 0.649519 \cdot P
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Designation==
A metric ISO screw thread is designated by the letter M followed by the value of the nominal diameter ''D'' (the ideal maximum thread diameter for external thread or the ideal minimum diameter for internal one) and the pitch ''P'', both expressed in millimetres and separated by the multiplication sign, ''×'' (e.g., M8×1.25). If the pitch is the normally used "coarse" pitch listed in ISO 261 or ISO 262, it can be omitted (e.g., M8). Tolerance classes defined in [[ISO 965|ISO 965-1]] can be appended to these designations, if required (e.g., M500– 6g in external threads).

External threads are designated by lowercase letter, g or h. Internal threads are designated by upper case letters, G or H.

=={{anchor|ISO 261|ISO 262}} Preferred sizes==
'''ISO 261''' specifies a detailed list of preferred combinations of outer diameter ''D'' and pitch ''P'' for ISO metric screw threads. The 1st choice column follows (approximately) the R10 series from ISO 3, while the 2nd choice column are rounded off values from the R20 series from ISO 3.&lt;ref&gt;

{{clear}}The “coarse” pitch is the commonly used default pitch for a given diameter. In addition, one or two smaller “fine” pitches are defined, for use in applications where the height of the normal “coarse” pitch would be unsuitable (e.g., threads in thin-walled pipes). The terms “coarse” and “fine” have (in this context) no relation to the manufacturing quality of the thread.

In addition to coarse and fine threads, there is another division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine pitch thread. Superfine pitch metric threads are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950018571.pdf |title=Final report |website=ntrs.nasa.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanner (Wrench) sizes==
Below are some common spanner (wrench) sizes for metric screw threads. Hex head widths (width across flats, wrench size) are for [[Deutsches_Institut_für_Normung|DIN]] 934 hex nuts and hex head bolts. Other (usually smaller) sizes may occur for reasons of weight and cost reduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44436">[[File:Dubendorf floodgate.jpg|thumb|Screw thread, used to convert torque into the linear force in the [[flood gate]]. The operator rotates the two vertical bevel gears that have threaded holes, thereby raising or lowering the two long vertical threaded shafts which are not free to rotate (via [[bevel gear]]).]]

A '''screw thread''', often shortened to '''thread''', is a [[helix|helical]] structure used to convert between rotational and linear movement or force. A screw thread is a ridge wrapped around a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[cone (geometry)|cone]] in the form of a helix, with the former being called a ''straight'' thread and the latter called a ''tapered'' thread. A screw thread is the essential feature of the [[screw (simple machine)|screw as a simple machine]] and also as a [[fastener]].

The [[mechanical advantage]] of a screw thread depends on its ''lead'', which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRdIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA137|title=Mathematics for Machinists|first=Reuben Wesley|last=Burnham|date=4 April 2018|publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons, Incorporated|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most applications, the lead of a screw thread is chosen so that [[friction]] is sufficient to prevent linear motion being converted to rotary, that is so the screw does not slip even when linear force is applied, as long as no external rotational force is present. This characteristic is essential to the vast majority of its uses. The tightening of a fastener's screw thread is comparable to driving a wedge into a gap until it sticks fast through friction and slight [[Deformation (engineering)#Elastic deformation|elastic deformation]].

==Applications==
Screw threads have several applications:
* Fastening:
** Fasteners such as [[wood screw]]s, machine screws, [[nut (hardware)|nuts]], and [[bolt (fastener)|bolt]]s.
** Connecting [[threaded pipe]]s and [[hose (tubing)|hose]]s to each other and to caps and fixtures.
* Gear reduction via [[worm drive]]s
* Moving objects linearly by converting rotary motion to linear motion, as in the [[leadscrew]] of a [[Jack (device)|jack]].
* Measuring by correlating linear motion to rotary motion (and simultaneously amplifying it), as in a [[micrometer]].
* Both moving objects linearly and simultaneously measuring the movement, combining the two aforementioned functions, as in a leadscrew of a [[lathe]].

In all of these applications, the screw thread has two main functions:
* It converts rotary motion into linear motion.
* It prevents linear motion without the corresponding rotation.

==Design==

===Gender===
{{Main|Gender of connectors and fasteners}}

Every matched pair of threads, ''external'' and ''internal'', can be described as ''male'' and ''female''. For example, a [[screw]] has male threads, while its matching hole (whether in nut or substrate) has female threads. This property is called ''gender''.

===Handedness===
{{main|Chirality}}
[[File:Screw thread handedness.png|thumb|upright|Right- and left-handed screw threads]]
[[File:Right-hand grip rule.svg|thumb|upright|The right-hand rule of screw threads]]

The helix of a thread can twist in two possible directions, which is known as ''handedness''. Most threads are oriented so that the threaded item, when seen from a point of view on the axis through the center of the helix, moves away from the viewer when it is turned in a [[clockwise]] direction, and moves towards the viewer when it is turned counterclockwise. This is known as a ''right-handed'' (''RH'') thread, because it follows the [[right hand grip rule]]. Threads oriented in the opposite direction are known as ''left-handed'' (''LH'').

By common convention, right-handedness is the default handedness for screw threads. Therefore, most threaded parts and fasteners have right-handed threads. Left-handed thread applications include:
* Where the rotation of a shaft would cause a conventional right-handed nut to loosen rather than to tighten due to applied torque or to [[Precession (mechanical)|fretting induced precession]]. Examples include:
** The [[bicycle pedal|left hand pedal]] on a [[bicycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_p.html#pedal | title=Bicycle Glossary: Pedal
| accessdate=2010-10-19|last=Brown |first=Sheldon |authorlink=Sheldon Brown (bicycle mechanic) |publisher=Sheldon Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The left-hand grinding wheel on a [[bench grinder]].
** The axle nuts, or less commonly, [[lug nut]]s on the left side of some automobiles.
** The securing nut on some circular saw blades – the large [[torque]] at startup should tend to tighten the nut.
** The spindle on [[brushcutter (garden tool)|brushcutter]] and [[line trimmer]] heads, so that the torque tends to tighten rather than loosen the connection
* In combination with right-hand threads in [[turnbuckle]]s and clamping studs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directindustry.com/prod/s-w-manufacturing-co-inc/clamping-studs-57807-574221.html|title=Threaded stud / steel / clamping – S&amp;W Manufacturing Co., Inc.|author=|date=|website=www.directindustry.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some gas supply connections to prevent dangerous misconnections, for example:
** In gas welding the flammable gas supply uses left-handed threads, while the oxygen supply if there is one has a conventional thread
** The [[POL valve]] for [[LPG cylinder]]s
* In a situation where neither threaded pipe end can be rotated to tighten or loosen the joint (e.g. in traditional heating pipes running through several rooms in a building). In such a case, the [[Coupling (piping)|coupling]] will have one right-handed and one left-handed thread.
* In some instances, for example early [[ballpoint pen]]s, to provide a "secret" method of disassembly.
* In mechanisms to give a more intuitive action as:
** The leadscrew of the cross slide of a [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] to cause the cross slide to move away from the operator when the leadscrew is turned clockwise.
** The depth of cut screw of a "Bailey" (or "Stanley-Bailey") type metal [[plane (tool)]] for the blade to move in the direction of a regulating right hand finger.
* Some [[Edison base]] lamps and fittings (such as those formerly used on the [[New York City Subway]]) have a left-hand thread to deter theft, since they cannot be used in other light fixtures.

===Form===
[[File:Different Thread Types.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Different threads including metric, USC, USF, BSW]]The cross-sectional shape of a thread is often called its ''form'' or ''threadform'' (also spelled ''thread form''). It may be [[Square (geometry)|square]], [[Triangle|triangular]], [[trapezoid]]al, or other shapes. The terms ''form'' and ''threadform'' sometimes refer to all design aspects taken together (cross-sectional shape, pitch, and diameters).

Most triangular threadforms are based on an [[isosceles triangle]]. These are usually called ''V-threads'' or ''vee-threads'' because of the shape of the [[V|letter V]]. For 60° V-threads, the isosceles triangle is, more specifically, [[Equilateral triangle|equilateral]]. For [[buttress thread]]s, the triangle is [[wikt:scalene|scalene]].

The theoretical triangle is usually [[wikt:truncation|truncated]] to varying degrees (that is, the tip of the triangle is cut short). A V-thread in which there is no truncation (or a minuscule amount considered negligible) is called a ''sharp V-thread''. Truncation occurs (and is codified in standards) for practical reasons—the thread-cutting or thread-forming tool cannot practically have a perfectly sharp point, and truncation is desirable anyway, because otherwise:
* The cutting or forming tool's edge will break too easily;
* The part or fastener's thread crests will have [[Burr (metal)|burrs]] upon cutting, and will be too susceptible to additional future burring resulting from dents (nicks);
* The roots and crests of mating male and female threads need clearance to ensure that the sloped sides of the V meet properly despite (a) error in pitch diameter and (b) dirt and nick-induced burrs.
* The point of the threadform adds little strength to the thread.

In [[ball screw]]s, the male-female pairs have bearing balls in between. [[Roller screw]]s use conventional thread forms and threaded rollers instead of balls.

===Angle===
{{Main|Thread angle}}

The included angle characteristic of the cross-sectional shape is often called the ''thread angle''. For most V-threads, this is standardized as 60 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], but any angle can be used.
The cross section to measure this angle lies on a plane which includes the axis of the cylinder or cone on which the thread is produced.

===Lead, pitch, and starts===&lt;!-- [[Threads per inch]], [[thread pitch]], [[Pitch (screw)]] &amp; [[Turn per inch]] redirect here --&gt;
{{Redirect|Threads per inch|woven fabrics|Units of textile measurement#Thread count}}
{{Main|Lead (engineering)}}
{{Other uses|Pitch (disambiguation){{!}}Pitch}}
[[File:Lead and pitch.png|thumb|Lead and pitch for two screw threads; one with one start and one with two starts]]

''Lead'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|d}} and ''pitch'' are closely related concepts. They can be confused because they are the same for most screws. ''Lead'' is the distance along the screw's axis that is covered by one complete rotation of the screw (360°). ''Pitch'' is the distance from the crest of one thread to the next. Because the vast majority of screw threadforms are ''single-start'' threadforms, their lead and pitch are the same. Single-start means that there is only one "ridge" wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of one ridge. "Double-start" means that there are two "ridges" wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body.&lt;ref&gt;Bhandari, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of two ridges. Another way to express this is that lead and pitch are parametrically related, and the [[parameter]] that relates them, the number of starts, very often has a value of 1, in which case their relationship becomes equality. In general, lead is equal to pitch times the number of starts.

Whereas metric threads are usually defined by their pitch, that is, how much distance per thread, inch-based standards usually use the reverse logic, that is, how many threads occur per a given distance. Thus, inch-based threads are defined in terms of ''threads per inch'' (TPI). Pitch and TPI describe the same underlying physical property—merely in different terms. When the inch is used as the unit of measurement for pitch, TPI is the reciprocal of pitch and vice versa. For example, a {{frac|1|4}}-20 thread has 20 TPI, which means that its pitch is {{frac|1|20}} inch ({{convert|0.050|in|mm|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

As the distance from the crest of one thread to the next, pitch can be compared to the [[wavelength]] of a [[wave]]. Another wave analogy is that pitch and TPI are inverses of each other in a similar way that [[Frequency|period and frequency]] are inverses of each other.

====Coarse versus fine====
Coarse threads are those with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). Coarse threads have a larger threadform relative to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a [[saw]] or [[File (tool)|file]], or between coarse grit and fine grit on [[sandpaper]].

The common V-thread standards ([[ISO 261]] and [[Unified Thread Standard]]) include a coarse pitch and a fine pitch for each major diameter. For example, {{frac|1|2}}-13 belongs to the UNC series (Unified National Coarse) and {{frac|1|2}}-20 belongs to the UNF series (Unified National Fine). Similarly, ISO261 M10 (10mm (398 thou) nominal outer diameter) has a coarse thread version at 1.25mm pitch (49 thou) and a fine thread version at 1&amp;nbsp;mm (39 thou) pitch.

The term ''coarse'' here does not mean lower quality, nor does the term ''fine'' imply higher quality. The terms when used in reference to screw thread pitch have nothing to do with the tolerances used (degree of precision) or the amount of craftsmanship, quality, or cost. They simply refer to the size of the threads relative to the screw diameter.

Coarse threads are more resistant to stripping and cross threading because they have greater flank engagement. Coarse threads install much faster as they require fewer turns per unit length. Finer threads are stronger as they have a larger stress area for the same diameter thread. Fine threads are less likely to vibrate loose as they have a smaller helix angle and allow finer adjustment. Finer threads develop greater preload with less tightening torque.&lt;ref name=katonet&gt;{{cite web |title=Coarse Threads vs. Fine Threads |website=katonet.com |url=http://www.katonet.com/article/coarsevsfine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diameters===
[[File:Thread Profile Diameters.jpg|thumb|The three diameters that characterize threads]]

There are three characteristic diameters of threads: ''major diameter'', ''minor diameter'', and ''pitch diameter'': Industry standards specify minimum (min.) and maximum (max.) limits for each of these, for all recognized thread sizes. The minimum limits for ''external'' (or ''bolt'', in ISO terminology), and the maximum limits for ''internal'' (''nut''), thread sizes are there to ensure that threads do not strip at the tensile strength limits for the parent material. The minimum limits for internal, and maximum limits for external, threads are there to ensure that the threads fit together.

====Major diameter====
The major diameter of threads is the larger of two extreme diameters delimiting the height of the thread profile, as a cross-sectional view is taken in a plane containing the axis of the threads. For a screw, this is its outside diameter (OD). The major diameter of a nut may not be directly measured, but it may be tested with go/no-go gauges.

The major diameter of external threads is normally smaller than the major diameter of the internal threads, if the threads are designed to fit together. But this requirement alone does not guarantee that a bolt and a nut of the same pitch would fit together: the same requirement must separately be made for the minor and pitch diameters of the threads. Besides providing for a clearance between the ''crest'' of the bolt threads and the ''root'' of the nut threads, one must also ensure that the clearances are not so excessive as to cause the fasteners to fail.

====Minor diameter====
[[File:ISO and UTS Thread Dimensions.svg|thumb|The basic profile of all UTS threads is the same as that of all [[ISO metric screw thread]]s. Only the commonly used values for ''D''&lt;sub&gt;maj&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P'' differ between the two standards.]]

The minor diameter is the lower extreme diameter of the thread. Major diameter minus minor diameter, divided by two, equals the height of the thread. The minor diameter of a nut is its inside diameter. The minor diameter of a bolt can be measured with go/no-go gauges or, directly, with an [[optical comparator]].

As shown in the figure at right, threads of equal pitch and angle that have matching minor diameters, with differing major and pitch diameters, may appear to fit snugly, but only do so radially; threads that have only major diameters matching (not shown) could also be visualized as not allowing radial movement. The reduced ''material condition'', due to the unused spaces between the threads, must be minimized so as not to overly weaken the fasteners.

====Pitch diameter====
[[File:Diagram of thread combinations of snug fit.jpg|thumb|Variants of snug fit. Only threads with matched PDs are truly snug, axially as well as radially.]]

The pitch diameter (PD, or ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of a particular thread, internal or external, is the diameter of a cylindrical surface, axially concentric to the thread, which intersects the thread flanks at equidistant points, when viewed in a cross-sectional plane containing the axis of the thread, the distance between these points being exactly one half the pitch distance. Equivalently, a line running parallel to the axis and a distance ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; away from it, the "PD line," slices the ''sharp-V'' form of the thread, having flanks coincident with the flanks of the thread under test, at exactly 50% of its height. We have assumed that the flanks have the proper shape, angle, and pitch for the specified thread standard. It is generally unrelated to the major (''D'') and minor (''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) diameters, especially if the crest and root truncations of the sharp-V form at these diameters are unknown. Everything else being ideal, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D'', &amp; ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, together, would fully describe the thread form. Knowledge of PD determines the position of the sharp-V thread form, the sides of which coincide with the straight sides of the thread flanks: e.g., the crest of the external thread would truncate these sides a radial displacement ''D''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; away from the position of the PD line.

Provided that there are moderate non-negative clearances between the root and crest of the opposing threads, and everything else is ideal, if the pitch diameters of a screw and nut are exactly matched, there should be no play at all between the two as assembled, even in the presence of positive root-crest clearances. This is the case when the flanks of the threads come into intimate contact with one another, before the roots and crests do, if at all.

However, this ideal condition would in practice only be approximated and would generally require wrench-assisted assembly, possibly causing the galling of the threads. For this reason, some ''allowance'', or minimum difference, between the PDs of the internal and external threads has to generally be provided for, to eliminate the possibility of deviations from the ideal thread form causing ''interference'' and to expedite hand assembly up to the length of engagement. Such allowances, or ''fundamental deviations'', as ISO standards call them, are provided for in various degrees in corresponding ''classes'' of fit for ranges of thread sizes. At one extreme, no allowance is provided by a class, but the maximum PD of the external thread is specified to be the same as the minimum PD of the internal thread, within specified tolerances, ensuring that the two can be assembled, with some looseness of fit still possible due to the margin of tolerance. A class called ''interference fit'' may even provide for negative allowances, where the PD of the screw is greater than the PD of the nut by at least the amount of the allowance.

The pitch diameter of external threads is measured by various methods: 
* A dedicated type of [[micrometer]], called a thread mic or pitch mic, which has a V-anvil and a conical spindle tip, contacts the thread flanks for a direct reading.
* A general-purpose micrometer (flat anvil and spindle) is used over a set of three wires that rest on the thread flanks, and a known constant is subtracted from the reading. (The wires are truly gauge pins, being ground to precise size, although "wires" is their common name.) This method is called the 3-wire method. Sometimes grease is used to hold the wires in place, helping the user to juggle the part, mic, and wires into position.
* An [[optical comparator]] may also be used to determine PD graphically.

===Classes of fit===
The way in which male and female fit together, including [[Backlash (engineering)|play]] and friction, is classified (categorized) in thread standards. Achieving a certain [[Engineering fit|class of fit]] requires the ability to work within tolerance ranges for dimension (size) and [[surface roughness|surface finish]]. Defining and achieving classes of fit are important for [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]]. Classes include 1, 2, 3 (loose to tight); A (external) and B (internal); and various systems such as H and D limits.

====Tolerance classes====

====Thread limit====
'''Thread limit''' or '''pitch diameter limit''' is a standard used for classifying the tolerance of the thread pitch diameter for [[tap and die|taps]]. For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the pitch diameter is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted ''H3'', would have a pitch diameter 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base pitch diameter and would thus result in cutting an internal thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits which is the same system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of {{convert|0.013|mm|mil|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MH"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Green|editor1-first=Robert|title=Machinery's Handbook|isbn=0-8311-2575-6|page=893|edition=25|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.

The pitch diameter of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals 0.5 × pitch
example: 16 pitch thread = 1/16{{nbsp}}in = 0.0625{{nbsp}}in the pitch actual pitch diameter of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures 0.03125{{nbsp}}in.

===Standardization and interchangeability===
To achieve a predictably successful mating of male and female threads and assured interchangeability between males and between females, standards for form, size, and finish must exist and be followed. [[#Standardization|Standardization of threads]] is discussed below.

===Thread depth===
Screw threads are almost never made perfectly sharp (no truncation at the crest or root), but instead are truncated, yielding a final ''thread depth'' that can be expressed as a fraction of the pitch value. The UTS and ISO standards codify the amount of truncation, including tolerance ranges.

A perfectly sharp 60° V-thread will have a depth of thread ("height" from root to crest) equal to 0.866 of the pitch. This fact is intrinsic to the geometry of an equilateral triangle — a direct result of the basic [[trigonometric functions]]. It is independent of measurement units (inch vs mm). However, UTS and ISO threads are not sharp threads. The major and minor diameters delimit truncations on either side of the sharp V.

The nominal diameter of Metric (e.g. M8) and Unified (e.g. 5/16") threads is the theoretical major diameter of the male thread, which is truncated (diametrically) by 0.866/4 of the pitch from the dimension over the tips of the "fundamental" (sharp cornered) triangles. The resulting flats on the crests of the male thread are theoretically one eighth of the pitch wide (expressed with the notation {{frac|1|8}}''p'' or 0.125''p''), although the actual geometry definition has more variables than that. A full (100%) UTS or ISO thread has a height of around 0.65''p''.

Threads can be (and often are) truncated a bit more, yielding thread depths of 60% to 75% of the 0.65''p'' value. For example, a 75% thread sacrifices only a small amount of strength in exchange for a significant reduction in the force required to cut the thread. The result is that [[tap and die]] wear is reduced, the likelihood of breakage is lessened and higher cutting speeds can often be employed.

This additional truncation is achieved by using a slightly larger [[wikt:tap drill|tap drill]] in the case of female threads, or by slightly reducing the diameter of the threaded area of workpiece in the case of male threads, the latter effectively reducing the thread's [[#Major diameter|major diameter]]. In the case of female threads, tap drill charts typically specify sizes that will produce an approximate 75% thread. A 60% thread may be appropriate in cases where high tensile loading will not be expected. In both cases, the [[#Pitch diameter|pitch diameter]] is not affected. The balancing of truncation versus thread strength is similar to many engineering decisions involving the strength, weight and cost of material, as well as the cost to machine it.

===Taper===
Tapered threads are used on fasteners and pipe. A common example of a fastener with a tapered thread is a [[wood screw]].

The [[threaded pipe]]s used in some plumbing installations for the delivery of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is [[Threaded pipe#Tapered threads|slightly conical]]. Examples are the [[National pipe thread|NPT]] and [[British standard pipe thread|BSP]] series. The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint is created when a tapered externally threaded end is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires the application of a separate sealant into the joint, such as [[thread seal tape]], or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as [[pipe dope]], however some threaded pipe joints do not require a separate sealant.

==Standardization==
[[File:Screw thread Závit M16.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|An example of ''M16'', ISO metric screw thread]]

[[Standardization]] of screw threads has evolved since the early nineteenth century to facilitate compatibility between different manufacturers and users. The standardization process is still ongoing; in particular there are still (otherwise identical) competing metric and inch-sized thread standards widely used.&lt;ref name=market_share&gt;[http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/687806/ISO_TC_001__Screws_.pdf?nodeid=4938938&amp;vernum=0 ISO/TC/ 1 Business Plan], 2007-03-05, Version 1.3. Table 3: The market share of each screw thread, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Standard threads are commonly identified by short letter codes (M, UNC, etc.) which also form the prefix of the standardized designations of individual threads.

Additional product standards identify preferred thread sizes for screws and nuts, as well as corresponding bolt head and nut sizes, to facilitate compatibility between [[Wrench|spanners]] (wrenches) and other tools.

===ISO standard threads===
{{Main|ISO metric screw thread}}

The most common threads in use are the [[ISO metric screw thread]]s (M) for most purposes and [[British standard pipe thread|BSP threads]] (R, G) for pipes.

These were standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1947. Although metric threads were mostly unified in 1898 by the International Congress for the standardization of screw threads, separate metric thread standards were used in France, Germany, and Japan, and the Swiss had a set of threads for watches.

===Other current standards===
In particular applications and certain regions, threads other than the ISO metric screw threads remain commonly used, sometimes because of special application requirements, but mostly for reasons of [[backward compatibility]]:
* [[Unified Thread Standard]] (UTS), is the dominant thread standard used in the United States and Canada. It is defined in [http://www.asme.org/products/codes---standards/unified-inch-screw-threads--un-and-unr-thread-form ANSI/ASME B1.1 Unified Inch Screw Threads, (UN and UNR Thread Form)]. In some cases products are still made according the old ''American National Standard Series'', which has slightly different specifications, and has been technically obsolete since 1949. The old national standard is compatible with the newer unified standard, but is long out of date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ring-plug-thread-gages.com/ti-N-vs-UN.htm|title=American National Standard vs. Unified Inch Standard|accessdate=14 Mar 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unified standard includes:

=== History of standardization ===
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|Graphic representation of formulas for the pitches of threads of screw bolts]]

[[File:American Machinists Handbook--2e--p21--v001.png|thumb|A good summary of screw thread standards in current use in 1914 was given in Colvin FH, Stanley FA (eds) (1914): [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA16,M1 American Machinists' Handbook, 2nd ed], New York and London, McGraw-Hill, pp. 16–22. USS, metric, Whitworth, and [[British Association screw threads|BA]] standards are discussed. The SAE series was not mentioned—at the time this edition of the ''Handbook'' was being compiled, they were either still in development or just newly introduced.]]

[[File:Marks 1916 p667 American Screw Co standard.png|thumb|A table of standard sizes for machine screws as provided by the American Screw Company of Providence, Rhode Island, USA, and published in a ''Mechanical Engineers' Handbook'' of 1916. Standards seen here overlap with those found elsewhere marked as ASME and SAE standards and with the later Unified Thread Standard (UTS) of 1949 and afterward. One can see the theme of how later standards reflect a degree of continuation from earlier standards, sometimes with hints of long-ago intracompany origins. For example, compare the 6–32, 8–32, 10–24, and 10–32 options in this table with the UTS versions of those sizes, which are not identical but are so close that interchange would work.]]

The first historically important intra-company standardization of screw threads began with [[Henry Maudslay]] around 1800, when the modern [[screw-cutting lathe]] made interchangeable V-thread machine screws a practical commodity.&lt;ref name="Screw thread"&gt;Quentin R.

McFarland&lt;/ref&gt; During the next 40 years, standardization continued to occur on the intra- and inter-company levels.&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 9–10.]&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt many mechanics of the era participated in this zeitgeist; [[Joseph Clement]] was one of those whom history has noted. In 1841, [[Joseph Whitworth]] created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became a national standard for the United Kingdom called [[British Standard Whitworth]]. During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards. In April 1864, [[William Sellers]] presented a paper to the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], proposing a new standard to replace the US' poorly standardized screw thread practice. Sellers simplified the Whitworth design by adopting a thread profile of 60° and a flattened tip (in contrast to Whitworth's 55° angle and rounded tip).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anniversary.asme.org/2005landmarks3.shtml|title=ASME 125th Anniversary: Special 2005 Designation of Landmarks: Profound Influences in Our Lives: The United States Standard Screw Threads|author=|date=|website=asme.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp248-249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 248–249.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 60° angle was already in common use in America,&lt;ref name="Roe1916p249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 249.]&lt;/ref&gt; but Sellers's system promised to make it and all other details of threadform consistent.

The Sellers thread, easier for ordinary machinists to produce, became an important standard in the U.S. during the late 1860s and early 1870s, when it was chosen as a standard for work done under U.S. government contracts, and it was also adopted as a standard by highly influential railroad industry corporations such as the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Other firms adopted it, and it soon became a national standard for the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Roe1916p249" /&gt; later becoming generally known as the [[United States Standard thread]] (USS thread). Over the next 30 years the standard was further defined and extended and evolved into a set of standards including ''National Coarse (NC), National Fine (NF),'' and ''National Pipe Taper (NPT).'' Meanwhile, in Britain, the [[British Association screw threads]] were also developed and refined.

During this era, in continental Europe, the British and American threadforms were well known, but also various [[Metric system|metric]] thread standards were evolving, which usually employed 60° profiles. Some of these evolved into national or quasi-national standards. They were mostly unified in 1898 by the International Congress for the standardization of screw threads at [[Zurich]], which defined the new international metric thread standards as having the same profile as the Sellers thread, but with metric sizes. Efforts were made in the early 20th century to convince the governments of the U.S., UK, and Canada to adopt these international thread standards and the metric system in general, but they were defeated with arguments that the [[capital cost]] of the necessary retooling would drive some firms from profit to loss and hamper the economy. (The mixed use of dueling inch and metric standards has since cost much, much more, but the bearing of these costs has been more distributed across national and global economies rather than being borne up front by particular governments or corporations, which helps explain the lobbying efforts.){{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Sometime between 1912 and 1916, the [[SAE International|Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE)]] created an "SAE series" of screw thread sizes reflecting parentage from earlier USS and ASME standards.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, engineers found that ensuring the reliable interchangeability of screw threads was a multi-faceted and challenging task that was not as simple as just standardizing the major diameter and pitch for a certain thread. It was during this era that more complicated analyses made clear the importance of variables such as pitch diameter and surface finish.

A tremendous amount of engineering work was done throughout [[World War I]] and the following [[interwar period]] in pursuit of reliable interchangeability. Classes of fit were standardized, and new ways of generating and inspecting screw threads were developed (such as [[:File:ThreadGrinder1K.jpg|production thread-grinding machines]] and [[optical comparator]]s). Therefore, in theory, one might expect that by the start of World War II, the problem of screw thread interchangeability would have already been completely solved. Unfortunately, this proved to be false. Intranational interchangeability was widespread, but international interchangeability was less so. Problems with lack of interchangeability among American, Canadian, and British parts during World War II led to an effort to unify the inch-based standards among these closely allied nations, and the [[Unified Thread Standard]] was adopted by the Screw Thread Standardization Committees of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States on November 18, 1949 in [[Washington, D.C.]], with the hope that they would be adopted universally. (The original UTS standard may be found in ASA (now ANSI) publication, Vol. 1, 1949.) UTS consists of Unified Coarse (UNC), Unified Fine (UNF), Unified Extra Fine (UNEF) and Unified Special (UNS). The standard was widely taken up in the UK, although a small number of companies continued to use the UK's own British standards for Whitworth (BSW), British Standard Fine (BSF) and British Association (BA) micro-screws.

However, internationally, the [[Metrication|metric system was eclipsing inch-based measurement units]]. In 1947, the ISO was founded; and in 1960, the metric-based [[International System of Units]] (abbreviated ''SI'' from the French ''Système International'') was created. With continental Europe and much of the rest of the world turning to SI and ISO metric screw thread, the UK gradually leaned in the same direction. The ISO metric screw thread is now the standard that has been adopted worldwide and is slowly displacing all former standards, including UTS. In the U.S., where UTS is still prevalent, over 40% of products contain at least some ISO metric screw threads. The UK has completely abandoned its commitment to UTS in favour of ISO metric threads, and Canada is in between. [[Globalization]] of industries produces market pressure in favor of phasing out minority standards. A good example is the [[automotive industry]]; U.S. auto parts factories long ago developed the ability to conform to the ISO standards, and today very few parts for new cars retain inch-based sizes, regardless of being made in the U.S.

Even today, over a half century since the UTS superseded the USS and SAE series, companies still sell hardware with designations such as "USS" and "SAE" to convey that it is of inch sizes as opposed to metric. Most of this hardware is in fact made to the UTS, but the labeling and cataloging terminology is not always precise.

==Engineering drawing==
In American [[engineering drawing]]s, ANSI&amp;nbsp;Y14.6 defines standards for indicating threaded parts. Parts are indicated by their nominal diameter (the nominal major diameter of the screw threads), pitch (number of threads per inch), and the class of fit for the thread. For example, “.750-10UNC-2A” is male (A) with a nominal major diameter of 0.750 in, 10 threads per inch, and a class-2 fit; “.500-20UNF-1B” would be female (B) with a 0.500 in nominal major diameter, 20 threads per inch, and a class-1 fit. An arrow points from this designation to the surface in question.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson pp.&amp;nbsp;77–78 (page numbers may be from an earlier edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generation==
{{Main|Threading (manufacturing)}}

There are many ways to generate a screw thread, including the traditional subtractive types (e.g., various kinds of cutting [single-pointing, taps and dies, die heads, milling]; molding; casting [die casting, sand casting]; forming and rolling; grinding; and occasionally [[lapping]] to follow the other processes); newer [[additive manufacturing|additive techniques]]; and combinations thereof.

==Inspection==
{{Main|Threading (manufacturing)#Inspection}}

Another common inspection point is the straightness of a bolt or screw. This topic comes up often when there are assembly issues with predrilled holes as the first troubleshooting point is to determine if the fastener or the hole is at fault. ASME B18.2.9 "Straightness Gage and Gaging for Bolts and Screws" was developed to address this issue.  Per the scope of the standard, it describes the gage and procedure for checking bolt and screw straightness at maximum material condition (MMC) and provides default limits when not stated in the applicable product standard.

{{Screw drives}}
A '''screw drive''' is a system used to turn a [[screw]].&lt;ref name="sizes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/tools//screw_drive.htm |title=screw drive systems |publisher=Sizes.com |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Instruct&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlis|first=Egon "arcticpenguin" [pseudonym]|title=When a Phillips is not a Phillips Plus So Much More!|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/When-a-Phillips-is-not-a-Phillips-Plus-So-Much-Mor/|work=Instructables: share what you make|publisher=Instructables|accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, it is a set of shaped cavities and protrusions on the screw head that allows [[torque]] to be applied to it. Usually, it also involves a mating [[tool]], such as a [[screwdriver]], that is used to turn it. The following heads are categorized based on commonality, with some of the less-common drives being classified as "tamper-resistant".

Most heads come in a range of sizes, typically distinguished by a number, such as "Phillips #00". These sizes do not necessarily describe a particular dimension of the drive shape, but rather are arbitrary designations.

===Slot===
[[File:Screw Head - Slotted.svg|40px|left]]
The '''slot''' screw drive has a single slot in the fastener head and is driven by a "common blade" or flat-bladed [[screwdriver]]. It was the first type of screw drive to be developed, and for centuries it was the simplest and cheapest to make. Uniquely among common drives, it is straightforward to manufacture a slot head or drive by hand. The slotted screw is commonly found in existing products and installations, and is still used in some simple [[carpentry]], and applications where little [[torque]] is needed. It is used in restoration of old and antique furniture, vehicles and equipment. However, it is not well suited to installation with [[power tool]]s, because a power driver tends to slip out of the head, potentially damaging the screw and surrounding material. For this reason, cruciform and other drives have replaced it in most applications. The tool used to drive a slot is called a ''common blade'', ''flat-blade'', ''slot-head'', ''flat-tip''&lt;ref name="capotosto"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Capotosto | first = Rosario | title = Screwdriver Basics | journal = [[Popular Mechanics]] | volume = 173 | issue = 12 | pages = 82–83 |date=December 1996 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R2YEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82 | postscript =. | issn = 0032-4558 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''flat-head'' /&amp;#8202;''flathead''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Review | first = Princeton | title = Cracking the Asvab | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 2004 | page = 174 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VDEvmtc-qGgC&amp;pg=PA174 | isbn = 978-0-375-76430-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; screwdriver. A [[Grind#Typical_grinds|hollow-ground]] screwdriver is less likely to "cam out" (leave the slot due to torque being translated into an axial force), so more torque can be applied without damaging the screw head. Flat-blade jewelers' screwdrivers and the tips found in {{frac|1|4}}-inch drive sets are generally hollow-ground. Note that it is this typical chisel shape which allows 9 screwdrivers to drive 24 different slotted screw sizes, at the expense of fitting as a hollow ground screwdriver would, and increasing the possibility of damaging the fastener or surrounding area.

At least one mechanical method of temporarily holding a slotted screw to a matching screwdriver is available, the Quick-Wedge screw-holding screwdriver, first manufactured by the Kedman Company in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 1956|title=Screw Holding Screw Driver|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Audiocraft/Audiocraft-1956-04.pdf|journal=Audiocraft Magazine|volume=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dzus fastener]]s, which have a cam-lock body instead of a threaded rod, use a slot drive.

===  Coin-slot drive ===
[[File:Screw Head - Slotted.svg|40px|left]]Coin-slot drives are so-called because of the curved bottom of the recess that facilitates driving them with a suitable coin, are often used on items where the user is not likely to have a screwdriver when needed, such as on thumb-screws that attach cameras to tripod adapters and battery compartments in some equipment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Hi-Torque ===
Hi-Torque slot drives were designed by Alcoa Fastening Systems, for situations where very high torque is needed, along with the ability to repeatedly install and remove the fastener.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.instructables.com/id/When-a-Phillips-is-not-a-Phillips-Plus-So-Much-Mor/ When a Phillips Is Not a Phillips Plus So Much More!] - Instructables.com&lt;/ref&gt; The design features curved walls, unlike the straight-walled slot drive.

The Type II (Conical/Connie) design adds a conical cup that receives a centering pin on the driver, improving alignment of the driving tool to the fastener recess.

===Cross===
[[File:Screw head - cross.svg|left|40px]]
A '''cross''' or '''double-slot''' screw drive has two slots, oriented perpendicular to each other, in the fastener head; a slotted screwdriver is still used to drive just one of the slots. This type is usually found in cheaply-made roofing bolts and the like, where a thread of {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} or above has a large flattened [[pan head]]. The advantage is that they provide some measure of redundancy: should one slot be deformed in service, the second may still be used and the tool can not slip out.
{{clear}}

==Cruciform drives==
{{See also|1=#Cross|l1=Cross-slotted|2=#Torq-set|l2=Torq-set|3=#Phillips/square|l3=Phillips/square}}
The following are screw drives based on a '''[[cruciform]]''' shape; i.e., a cross shape. Other names for these types of drives are '''cross recessed''', '''cross-head''', '''cross tip''', and '''cross-point'''. A double slotted screw drive is not considered cruciform because the shape is not recessed, and consists only of two superimposed simple milled slots. Some of these types are specified in ISO 4757, ''Cross recesses for screws''.

===Frearson===
[[File:Screw Head - Frearson.svg|40px|left]]
[[File:Frearson vs Phillips.svg|thumb|150px]]
The '''Frearson''' screw drive, also known as the '''Reed and Prince''' screw drive, and specified as ANSI Type II Cross Recess, is similar to a Phillips but the Frearson has a sharp tip and larger angle in the V shape.&lt;ref name="ScrDrv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/tools/screw_drive.htm|title=Screw drive systems|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage over the Phillips drive is that one driver or bit fits all screw sizes. It is often found in marine hardware and requires a Frearson screwdriver or bit to work properly. The tool recess is a perfect, sharp cross, allowing for higher applied torque, unlike the rounded, tapered Phillips head, which can [[cam out]] at high torque. It was developed by an English inventor named Frearson in the 19th century and produced from the late 1930s to the mid-1970s. The Reed &amp; Prince Mfg. Company of Worcester, Massachusetts, was put into bankruptcy in 1987 and liquidated in 1990. Another entity called Reed &amp; Prince Manufacturing Corporation, now of Leominster, Massachusetts, purchased some of the assets including the name at the liquidation sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reedandprincemfg.com/|title=Reed &amp; Prince Manufacturing Corporation: Welcome|date=|publisher=Reedandprincemfg.com|accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Phillips''' screw drive (specified as an ANSI Type I Cross Recess&lt;ref name="MachineHandbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Machinery's Handbook|date=2004|publisher=Industrial Press, Inc.|page=1596|edition=27th|url=http://www.fennetic.net/irc/Machinery%27s%20Handbook%2027th%20Edition/27_Fast_08B.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was created by John P. Thompson, who after failing to interest manufacturers, sold his design to businessman [[Henry F. Phillips]].&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higgins|first1=Matt|title=What is the Difference: Screw Bits - Phillips vs. Pozidriv|journal=Fine Homebuilding|date=September 16, 2015|volume=154|issue=November 2015|page=38|url=http://www.finehomebuilding.com/toolguide/departments/what-is-the-difference/screw-bits-phillips-pozidriv.aspx|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Windham2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryder Windham|title=You Know You're in Rhode Island When...: 101 Quintessential Places, People, Events, Customs, Lingo, and Eats of the Ocean State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3CQKpve7WUC&amp;pg=PA60|year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-3940-0|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips is credited with forming a company ([[Phillips Screw Company]]), improving the design, and promoting the adoption of his product.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt; The original patent&lt;ref name="Patent-Phillips-screw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Means for uniting a screw with a driver|url=https://www.google.ca/patents/US2046837|website=US Patent and Trademark Office|publisher=US Government|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; expired in 1966, but the Phillips Screw Company continued to develop improved designs.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;

The [[American Screw Company]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was responsible for devising a means of efficiently manufacturing the screw, and successfully patented and licensed their method; other screw makers of the 1930s dismissed the Phillips concept because it called for a relatively complex recessed socket shape in the head of the screw &amp;mdash; as distinct from the simple milled slot of a slotted type screw. The Phillips screw design was developed as a direct solution to a number of problems with slotted screws: too-easy [[cam out]]; precise alignment required to avoid slippage and damage to driver, fastener, and adjacent surfaces; and difficulty of driving with powered tools.

Phillips drive bits are often designated by the letters "PH",&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt; plus a size code 0000, 000, 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (in order of increasing size); the numerical bit size codes do not necessarily correspond to nominal screw size numbers.&lt;ref name="capotosto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Docter |first=Quentin|last2=Dulaney|first2=Emmett |last3=Skandier|first3=Toby|title=CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide|page=766|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wu-CjtBWFwC&amp;pg=PA766|isbn=978-0-470-04831-3|postscript =.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Phillips screw head is significantly different from a PoziDriv;&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt; see {{Section link||Pozidriv}} section below for details.

The design is often criticized for its tendency to [[cam out]] at lower torque levels than other "cross head" designs.

The '''Pozidriv''' (sometimes incorrectly spelled "Pozidrive") is an improved version of the Phillips screw drive. It is designated "Type IA" by [[ANSI]] standards.&lt;ref name="ScrDrv" /&gt;

The Pozidriv was patented by [[GKN]] Screws and Fasteners in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1962-05-04|others=G K N SCREWS AND FASTENERS Ltd, G K N SCREWS AND FASTENERS Ltd|title=Improvements in or relating to screw threaded fasteners and drivers for use therewith|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/GB1006509A/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-11|others=Alan Pritchard, Research Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Inc.|title=Recessed head fastener and driver combination|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2016100110A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was specifically designed to allow more torque to be applied and greater engagement than Phillips drives. As a result, the Pozidriv is less likely to [[cam out]].&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;[http://www.phillips-screw.com/pozidriv.php Pozidriv page] at Phillips Screw Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiha.com/index.php/england/informationen_service/service/ratgeber/schraubprofile|title=Screw head types / Product Guides / Service / Information &amp; Services / England / Home&amp;nbsp;— Wiha &amp;#124; Screwdrivers L-Keys Bits Pliers Online Shop&amp;#124; Premium Tools for Professionals|date=2008-02-13|publisher=Web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213034011/http://www.wiha.com/index.php/england/informationen_service/service/ratgeber/schraubprofile|archivedate=2008-02-13|accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is similar to, and compatible with, the Supadriv screw drive.&lt;ref name="PoziSupa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goedkopeschroevenkopen.nl/unterschied-zwischen-pozidrive-und-superdrive|title=Difference between Pozidriv and Supadriv (in German)|date=|publisher=Goedkopeschroevenkopen.nl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222002716/http://goedkopeschroevenkopen.nl/unterschied-zwischen-pozidrive-und-superdrive|archivedate=February 22, 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pozidriv screwdrivers are often designated using the letters "PZ" followed by a size code of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 (in order of increasing size).&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt; The numbers do not necessarily correspond to nominal screw size numbers.

Pozidriv screws have a set of radial indentations (tick marks) set at 45° from the main cross recess on the head of the screw, which makes them visually distinct from Phillips screws.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;

While a Phillips screwdriver has slightly tapered flanks, a pointed tip, and rounded corners, a Pozidriv screwdriver has parallel flanks, a blunt tip, and additional smaller ribs at 45° to the main slots. The manufacturing process for Pozidriv screwdriver bits is therefore more complex than that for Phillips: while a Phillips screwdriver bit can be manufactured by cutting four simple slots, the Pozidriv screwdriver tip requires two machining processes at right angles for each slot.{{cn|date=March 2019}}

Pozidriv and Phillips are broadly interchangeable, but may cause damage if incorrectly used. While Pozidriv screwdrivers fit Phillips screws, they may slip or tear out the Phillips screw head. Conversely, while Phillips screwdrivers will loosely fit and turn Pozidriv screws, they will cam out if enough torque is applied, potentially damaging the screw head or screwdriver.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

===Supadriv===
[[File:Screw Head - Supadrive.svg|40px|left]]
The '''Supadriv''' (sometimes spelled incorrectly as "Supadrive") screw drive is very similar in function and appearance to Pozidriv. It is a later development by the same company. The description of the Pozidriv head applies also to Supadriv. While each has its own driver,&lt;ref name="step14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/When-a-Phillips-is-not-a-Phillips/step14/SupaDrivreg/|title=SupaDriv®|author=arcticpenguin|date=2008-12-29|publisher=Instructables.com|accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same screwdriver heads may be used for both types without damage; for most purposes it is unnecessary to distinguish between the two drives. Pozidriv and Supadriv screws are slightly different in detail; the later Supadriv allows a small angular offset between the screw and the screwdriver, while Pozidriv has to be directly in line.&lt;ref name="PoziSupa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SupaVsPozi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.jtbworld.com/2009/01/phillips-jis-pozidriv-supadriv-and.html|title=Phillips, JIS, Pozidriv, SupaDriv and other screw drive types|website=blog.jtbworld.com|accessdate=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11161184&amp;sort=whole]: "Supadrive allow a small angular offset between the screw and the screwdriver. Pozidrive have to be directly in line"&lt;/ref&gt;

In detail, the Supadriv screwhead is similar to Pozidriv but has only two identification ticks, and the secondary blades are larger. Drive blades are about equal thickness. The main practical difference is in driving screws into vertical surfaces:  that close to a near vertical surface to drive the screws into the drivers, Supadriv has superior bite, making screwdriving more efficient, with less [[cam out]].&lt;ref name=step14/&gt;

=== Phillips II ===
Phillips II recesses are compatible with Phillips drivers, but have a vertical rib in between the cruciform recesses that interacts with horizontal ribs on a Phillips II driver to create a stick-fit, and to provide anti cam-out properties (the ribs are trademarked as "ACR" for Anti Cam-out Ribs).{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The '''[[Japanese Industrial Standard|JIS]] B 1012''' is commonly found in Japanese equipment. It looks like a Phillips screw, but is designed not to [[cam out]] and will therefore be damaged by a Phillips screwdriver if it is too tight. Heads are usually identifiable by a single dot or an "X" to one side of the cross slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.instructables.com/id/When-a-Phillips-is-not-a-Phillips/step10/JIS-Japanese-Industrial-Standard/ | title=When a Phillips is not a Phillips! |publisher=Instructables.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific "JIS" standardized cruciform-blade screwdrivers are available for this type of screw.

===Mortorq===
[[File:Screw Head - Mortorq.svg|40px|left]]
The '''Mortorq''' drive, developed by the Phillips Screw Company, is a format used in automotive and aerospace applications. It is designed to be a lightweight, low-profile and high-strength drive, with full contact over the entire recess wing, reducing risk of stripping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillips-screw.com/mortorq_super.php|title=The Phillips Screw Company|website=www.phillips-screw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robertson ===
[[File:Screw Head - Robertson.svg|40px|left]]
[[File:Robertson screw.jpg|thumb|100px|upright|Close-up of a Robertson screw]]
A '''Robertson''', also known as a '''square'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qWYVk7lSsN4C&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Furniture Projects for the Deck and Lawn |publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Scrulox'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robertson Inc.|title=Robertson Inc. - The Original Robertson Fastening System|url=http://www.robertsonscrew.com/|work=Robertson Inc. main site|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; screw drive is specified as ANSI Type III Square Center and has a [[Square (geometry)|square]]-shaped socket in the screw head and a square protrusion on the tool. Both the tool and the socket have a slight [[Cone|taper]]. Originally to make the manufacture of the screws practical using [[cold forming]] of the heads,&lt;ref name="Rybczynski" /&gt;{{rp|79–81}} this taper provides two other advantages which have served to popularize the drive: it makes inserting the tool easier, and tends to help keep the screw on the tool tip without the user needing to hold it there. Robertson screws are commonplace in [[Canada]], though they have been used elsewhere&lt;ref name="Rybczynski"/&gt;{{rp|85–86}} and have become much more common in other countries in recent decades. As patents expired and awareness of their advantages spread, Robertson fasteners have become popular in [[woodworking]] and in general construction. Combination Robertson/Phillips drives are often used in the electrical trade, particularly in device &amp; breaker terminals, as well as clamp connectors.

Robertson screwdrivers are easy to use one-handed, because the tapered socket tends to retain the screw, even if it is shaken.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski"/&gt;{{rp|85–86}} They also allow for the use of angled screw drivers and trim head screws. The socket-headed Robertson screws are self-centering, reduce [[cam out]], stop a power tool when set, and can be removed if painted over or old and rusty.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski"/&gt;{{rp|85–86}} In industry, they speed up production and reduce product damage.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski"/&gt;{{rp|85–86}}

The internal-wrenching square socket drive for screws (as well as the corresponding triangular socket drive) was conceived several decades before the Canadian [[P. L. Robertson]] invented the Robertson screw and screwdriver in 1908 and received [[patent]]s in 1909 (Canada) and 1911 ({{US Patent|1,003,657}}). An earlier patent covering both square-socket- and [[#TA|triangle-socket]]-drive wood screws, {{US Patent|161,390}}, was issued to one Allan Cummings of New York City on March 30, 1875. However, as with other clever drive types conceived and patented in the 1860s through 1890s, it was not manufactured widely (if at all) during its patent lifespan due to the difficulty and expense of doing so at the time.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski" /&gt;{{rp|79–81}} Robertson's breakthrough in 1908 was to design the socket's taper and proportions in such a combination that the heads could be easily and successfully [[cold forming|cold formed]],&lt;ref name="Rybczynski" /&gt;{{rp|79–81}} which is what made such screws a valuable [[value proposition|commercial proposition]]. Today, cold forming (by stamping in a die) is still the common method used for most screws sold, although [[rotary broaching]] is also common now. Linear broaching to cut corners into a drilled hole (similar to the action of a [[mortising machine]] for woodworking) has also been used (less commonly) over the decades.

Robertson had licensed the screw design to a maker in England, but the party that he was dealing with intentionally drove the licensee company into bankruptcy and purchased the rights at a reduced price from the trustee, thus circumventing the original agreement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Robertson spent a small fortune buying back the rights, and subsequently refused to allow anyone else to make the screws under license. When [[Henry Ford]] tried out the Robertson screws, he found that they saved considerable time in [[Model T]] production, but when Robertson refused to license the screw design, Ford realized that the supply of screws would not be guaranteed and chose to limit their use in production to Ford's Canadian division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/Ontario/robertson_screws.htm| title=Robertson Screws}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://inventors.about.com/od/sstartinventions/a/screwdriver.htm| title=History of Screws and Screwdrivers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCZuETU7u5oC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=ford+robertson+screw#PPA58,M1| title=Caledonia: Along the Grand River| isbn=978-0-920474-81-5| author1=Martindale| first1=Barbara| date=1996-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson's refusal to license his screws prevented their widespread adoption in the United States, where the more widely-licensed Phillips head gained wider acceptance. The restriction of licensing of Robertson's internal-wrenching square may have sped [[Hex key#History|the development of the internal-wrenching hexagon]], although documentation of this is limited.

A new variation of the Robertson drive is the Nüvo Drive System, in which the screws are compatible with Robertson drive tools, but the screws have rounded lobes that, when used with Nüvo drivers, "dramatically reduce wobbling and stripping out, enabling single-handed operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuvoconcept.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Nuvo_Screws_2016_web.pdf|title=NUVO Screws 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiple-square drives ==

=== LOX-Recess ===
The LOX-Recess screw drive was invented by Brad Wagner, and fasteners using it are distributed by licencees Hitachi, Dietrick Metal Framing, and Grabber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lox.com/|title=LOX Maximum Torque with Minimum Effort|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is four overlapping square recesses, with 12 contact points, and is designed to increase torque, decrease wear, and avoid cam-out.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/tools/g2809/11-strange-screws/|title=11 Strange Screws You Don't See Every Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double-square ===
[[File:Screw Head - Double Square.svg|40px|left]]
The '''double-square''' drive is two [[#Robertson|Robertson]] squares{{citation needed|reason=The Robertson receptacle is tapered. Double- and triple-squares are not.|date=March 2017}} superimposed at 45° rotation, forming an 8-pointed star. The design is similar to a square drive (Robertson), but can be engaged at more frequent angles by the driver bit.
{{clear left}}

===Triple-square===
[[File:Screw Head - Triple Square.svg|40px|left]]
The '''triple-square''', also known as '''XZN''', is a type of screw drive with 12 equally spaced protrusions, each ending in a 90° internal angle.    The name derives from overlaying three equal squares to form such a pattern with 12 right-angled protrusions (a 12-pointed star). In other words, three [[#Robertson|Robertson]] squares are superimposed at a successive 30° rotation. The design is similar to that of the [[#Double-square|double-square]]—in both cases, the idea being that it resembles a square (Robertson) but can be engaged at more frequent angles by the driver bit.  These screws can be driven with standard Robertson bits.  

Sizes are M4, M5, M6, M8, M9, M10, M12, M14, M16, and M18. Despite the similar naming scheme to metric fasteners, there is no correlation between the name of the size and the dimensions of the tool.

The 12-pointed internal star shape superficially resembles the "double hex" fastener head, but differs subtly in that the points are shaped to an internal angle of 90° (derived from a square), rather than the 120° internal angle of a hexagon. In practice, drivers for the fasteners may or may not interchange, but should be examined carefully for proper fit before application of force. A hex key should not be used where a key of square cross-section is the correct fit.

Triple-square drive fasteners have been used in high-torque applications, such as [[cylinder head]] bolts and [[drive train]] components. The fasteners involved have heads that are hardened and tempered to withstand the driving torque without destroying the star points. They are commonly found on [[Germany|German]] [[vehicles]] such as [[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Opel]], [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[Porsche]] and [[Volkswagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanautoparts.com/Tools/Volkswagen GermanAutoParts.com Volkswagen Tools]&lt;!-- Not intended as SPAM, just an easy reference --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal hex drives==
{{Main|Hex key}}

=== Hex socket ===
[[File:Screw Head - Hex Socket.svg|40px|left]]
[[File:Inbus-sruby.jpg|thumb|150px|Hex socket screws]]
The '''hex socket''' screw drive has a hexagonal recess and may be driven by a ''hex wrench'', also known as an ''Allen wrench'', ''Allen key'', ''hex key'', or ''inbus'' as well as by a hex screwdriver (also known as a hex driver) or bit. Tamper-resistant versions with a pin in the recess are available. Metric sizes of the hex socket are defined by ISO 4762 (socket head cap screws), ISO 4026 (socket set screws with flat point), ISO 4027 (socket set screws with cone point), ISO 4028 (socket set screws with dog point), and ISO 4029 (socket set screws with cup point).

The German company Bauer &amp; Schaurte patented the hex socket 1936 in Germany, and marketed products based on it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The term "inbus" is derived from '''''In'''nensechskant '''B'''auer '''u'''. '''S'''chaurte'' (German: "Inner 6-edge Bauer &amp; Schaurte"), analogous to the US term "Allen key". In many countries it is commonly but incorrectly called "i'''m'''bus".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
{{clear left}}

===Double hex===
[[File:Screw Head - Double Hex.svg|40px|left]]
'''Double hex''' is a screw drive with a socket shaped as two coaxial offset hex recesses; it can be driven by standard hex key tools. The shape resembles triple square and spline screw drives, but they are incompatible.

The radial "height" of each [[arris]] is reduced, compared to a six-point, although their number is doubled. They are potentially capable of allowing more torque than a six-point, but greater demands are placed on the metallurgy of the heads and the tools used, to avoid rounding off and slippage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
{{clear left}}

==Pentalobular sockets==
===ASTER recess===
The '''ASTER recess''' was designed by LISI Aerospace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lisi-aerospace.com/products/fasteners/tooling/installation-tooling/Pages/aster-keys.aspx|title=ASTER™ System|website=www.lisi-aerospace.com|language=fr-fr|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to provide a more reliable solution than the hexagonal recess for assemblies of composite structures on aircraft. This recess is optimized to fit on the threaded end of aerospace fasteners. These fasteners allows for tightening the nut and holding the bolt simultaneously, on the same side of the structure, by only one operator.

==Hexalobular sockets==
{{Main|Torx}}

=== Torx ===
[[File:Screw Head - Torx.svg|40px|left]]
[[File:Torx.jpg|thumb|upright|Torx driver]]
The '''hexalobular socket''' screw drive, often referred to by the original proprietary brand name '''[[Torx]]''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|'|t|ɔːr|k|s}}) or by the alternative generic name '''star drive''', uses a star-shaped recess in the fastener with six rounded points. It was designed to permit increased torque transfer from the driver to the bit compared to other drive systems. The drive was developed in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3584667}} filed 1967-03-21&lt;/ref&gt; by Camcar [[Textron]].&lt;ref&gt;Camcar eventually became part of Textron Fastening Systems in the 1990s. In 2006 Textron Fastening Systems was sold to Platinum Equities, LLC, of Beverly Hills, California. They renamed the company [http://www.acument.com/ Acument Global Technologies], which as of 2010 includes Avdel, Camcar, Ring Screw, and others.&lt;/ref&gt; Torx is very popular in the automotive and electronics industries because of resistance to [[cam out]], and extended bit life, as well as reduced operator fatigue by minimizing the need to bear down on the drive tool to prevent cam out. A tamper-resistant '''[[List_of_screw_drives#Security_Torx|Security Torx]]''' head has a small pin inside the recess. Owing to its six-fold symmetry, a Torx driver can also be used as an improvised substitute for a hex driver, although careful sizing is critical to prevent stripping the socket.

=== Torx Plus ===
[[File:Wkretaki-07 torx plus.svg|40px|left]]'''Torx Plus''' is an improved version of Torx that extends tool life even further and permits greater torque transfer compared to Torx. The Tamper-resistant variant, often called '''Torx Plus Security''', is a five-lobed variant, with a center post. These "5-star" Torx configurations are commonly encountered in [[prison]]s, public facilities and public schools, but can also be found in some electronic devices. [[Torx#TTAP|'''Torx TTAP''']] is a version of Torx that reduces wobbling between the fastener and the tool, and is [[backward compatible]] with standard hexalobular tools. An '''External Torx''' version exists, where the screw head has the shape of a Torx screwdriver bit, and a Torx socket is used to drive it. See {{Section link||External Torx}}.

==Combination drives==
[[File:Screw Head - Phillips Combo.svg|40px|left]]
Some screws have heads designed to accommodate more than one kind of driver, sometimes referred to as combo-head or combi-head. The most common of these is a combination of a '''slotted and Phillips head''', often used in attaching knobs to furniture drawer fronts. Because of its prevalence, there are now drivers made specifically for this kind of screw head. Other combinations are a Phillips and Robertson, a Robertson and a slotted, a Torx and a slotted and a triple-drive screw that can take a slotted, Phillips or a Robertson.

Combined slotted/pozidriv heads are so ubiquitous in electrical switchgear to have earned the nickname "electrician's screws" (the first screwdriver out of the toolbox is used, and the user does not have to waste valuable time searching for the correct driver). Their rise to popular use has been in spite of the fact that neither a flat screwdriver or Pozidriv screwdriver are fully successful in driving these screws to the required torque. Some screwdriver manufacturers offer matching screwdrivers and call them "contractor screwdrivers", although the original concept of not needing to search for a particular driver being defeated as a contractor screwdriver is useless for non-combination heads. Slotted/Phillips (as opposed to slotted/pozidriv) heads occur in some North American-made switchgear.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== ACR Phillips II Plus ===
ACR Phillips II Plus is a screw-drive design that can be driven by a #2 Phillips driver or a #2 Robertson driver, but when driven by a Phillips II Plus Bit, the combination results in a stick-fit interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phillipsii.com/|title=Phillips II High-Performance Screws|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Phillips/square===
[[File:Screw Head - Quadrex.svg|40px|left]]
The '''Phillips/square''' screw drive, also known as the '''{{visible anchor|Quadrex}}''', '''{{visible anchor|Pozisquare}}''' screw drive, is a combination of the Phillips and Robertson screw drives. While a standard Phillips or Robertson tool can be used, there is also a dedicated tool for it that increases the surface area between the tool and the fastener so it can handle more torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = McMaster-Carr catalog | publisher = McMaster-Carr | edition = 116th | page = 2806 | url = http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/116/2806/ | accessdate = 2010-06-11 | postscript =. | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recex ===
The '''Recex''' drive system claims it offers the combined non-slip convenience of a Robertson drive during production assembly and Phillips for after market serviceability. The Phillips Screw Company offers both Phillips and Pozidriv combo heads with Robertson.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Slotted/Torx===
[[File:TORX_T25-Slot_Dual_Drive.jpg|thumb|A Torx T25/slot Dual Drive screw, with a 3/16-inch flat-blade screwdriver on the left, and a T25 screwdriver on the right. Both screwdrivers can drive this screw, by design.]]
A combined slotted and Torx drive screw was used in electronics manufacturing. For example, [[Compaq]] used this type to combine the benefits of Torx in manufacturing and the commonality of flat drive in field repair situations. The slot was closed on the ends to prevent the flat-blade tool from slipping out sideways and damaging nearby electronics.

There are two types of '''clutch''' screw drives: Type A and Type G. Type A, also known as a "standard clutch", resembles a [[bow tie]], with a small circular "knot" at the center. These were common in [[General Motors|GM]] automobiles, trucks and buses of the 1940s and 1950s. Type G resembles a butterfly, and lacks the center "knot". This type of screw head is commonly used in the manufacture of [[mobile homes]] and [[recreational vehicles]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The clutch head was designed to be driven with a flat-blade screwdriver as well as a clutch driver.

===Thumbscrew===
A '''thumbscrew''' is a type of screw drive with either a tall head and ridged or [[knurl]]ed sides, or a key-like flat sided vertical head. They are intended to be tightened and loosened by hand, and not found in structural applications. They are sometimes also cut for [[Phillips head]] or slotted screwdrivers as well as having the knurl for finger grip. [[ASME]] 18.6.8 covers dimensions for Type A (shoulder under the head), regular and heavy, along with Type B (without shoulder), regular and heavy. They can be found on many computer cases, and in other locations where easy access without tools is desired.

==External drives==
External drives are characterized by a [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|female]] tool and a [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|male]] fastener. An advantage of external drive fasteners is that they lack a recess in the head, which can collect water, dirt, or paint, which can interfere with later insertion of a driver tool. Also, some external drives can be engaged from the side, without requiring large inline clearance for tool access, which allows their use in tight spaces such as engines or complex pipework. Because the heads must stand out from the surface they attach to, they are rarely available in countersunk or flush designs.

===Square===
[[File:Screw Head - Square External.svg|40px|left]]
A '''square''' screw drive uses four-sided fastener heads which can be turned with an [[adjustable wrench]], [[open-end wrench]], or 8- or 12-point&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Digest | first = Reader's | title = Family Handyman Best Projects, Tips and Tools | publisher = Readers Digest | page = 106 | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fFkObm6DvXwC&amp;pg=PA106 | isbn = 978-0-7621-0455-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[socket wrench|sockets]]. Common in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was easier and cheaper to manufacture than most other drives, it is less common today (although still easy to find) because the external hex is now cost-competitive and allows better access for wrenching despite nearby obstructions.
{{clear left}}

===Hex===
{{anchor|hex head cap screw}}
[[File:Screw Head - Hex External.svg|40px|left]]
A '''hex''' screw drive uses six-sided fastener heads, and the fastener is known as a '''hex head cap screw'''. It can be turned with an adjustable wrench, [[combination wrench]] and 6- or 12-point [[socket wrench|sockets]]. The hex drive is better than square drive for locations where surrounding obstacles limit wrenching access, because smaller wrench-swing arcs can still successfully rotate the fastener. Metric sizes of the hex are specified by ISO 4032 and ISO 4033, plus ISO 4035 for Jam Nuts, and ISO 4014 and ISO 4017 for hex cap screws, ISO 4018 for Hex head screws (grade c).

===Pentagon===
{{anchor|penta screw}}
[[File:Screw Head - Pentagon External.svg|40px|left]]
A '''pentagon''' screw drive uses five-sided fastener heads, and the fastener is known as a '''penta screw''' or '''penta bolt'''. It is designed to be intrinsically incompatible with many tools. Since five is an [[odd number]], it cannot be turned by open-end or [[adjustable wrench]]es, which have parallel faces (and thus require a fastener with an even number of sides). Moreover, it cannot be turned by typical consumer- and professional-grade socket drivers, which possess either six or twelve points (neither of which are [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]]s of five). '''Penta nut''' security fasteners also are available, which can only be driven by specialized five-sided socket drivers.

Due to the difficulty of turning these fasteners without specialized (and uncommon) five-point wrenches such as [[hydrant wrench]]es, they are commonly used for tamper resistance by [[public utility|public utilities]] on [[water meter]] covers, natural gas valves, electrical cabinets, and [[fire hydrant]]s.
{{clear left}}

===External Torx===
[[File:Screw Head - Torx External.svg|40px|left]]
An '''external Torx''' screw has a projecting head in the shape of a Torx screwdriver bit (instead of a standard recessed cavity); a Torx socket is used to drive it. The external "E" Torx nominal sizing does not correspond to the "T" size (for example, an E40 socket is too large to fit a T40, while an E8 Torx socket will fit a T40 Torx bit&lt;ref name="WihaChart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wihatools.com/Marketing/torxspec.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226084217/http://www.wihatools.com/Marketing/torxspec.htm|archive-date=2015-12-26|title=Chart of Torx fasteners and tools|publisher=Wiha Tools USA|accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These screws are most commonly encountered in the motor industry.

===12-point===
[[File:Screw Head - 12-Point external.svg|40px|left]]
A '''12-point''' screw drive uses two overlapped hexagon shapes, one rotated by 30º.  Standard 12-point hex socket bits and wrenches fit these screws.  The screw heads are typically flanged, and may fit into standard Allen hex socket cap screw counterbores molded or machined into parts to be fastened.  Compared to Allen hex sockets, the advantages of these bolts include higher torque capability and the lack of a recess to trap water.  A disadvantage is the extra cost involved in forming the heads.

==Tamper-resistant types==

[[File:Set of security screw driver bits.jpg|thumb|A set of "secure" or otherwise less common screwdriver bits, including secure Torx and secure hex or "allen" variants.]]

Most of the following screw drives are considered [[tamper-resistance|tamper-resistant]] because of their [[security through obscurity|obscurity]]. Tamper-resistant drives are commonly used on equipment such as [[home electronics]], to prevent easy access thereby reducing the incidence of damage, improper repairs or repairs by people with the relevant technical knowledge without having to return the unit to the manufacturer. However, widespread recent availability of assorted drive bits (including security types) minimizes this advantage, at least for some fastener types. True tamper-resistant screw drives include the breakaway head and one-way screw drives.

In addition to screw drives, various nut drives have been designed to make removal difficult without specialized tools. Proprietary examples include T-Groove, Slot-Lok, Pentagon, Tork-Nut, T-Slope and Spanner designs.&lt;ref name=TPNuts&gt;{{cite web|title=Tamper Proof Nuts|url=http://www.losspreventionfasteners.com/products/tamperproof-security-nuts/|website=Loss Prevention Fasteners|publisher=Ultra Fasteners Inc|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakaway head===
The '''breakaway head''' (also called '''breakoff''' or '''shear''' fastener)&lt;ref name=TorkBolt&gt;{{cite web|title=Tork-Bolts|url=http://www.losspreventionfasteners.com/store/products/tork-bolts/|website=Loss Prevention Fasteners|publisher=Ultra Fasteners Inc.|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a high-security fastener whose head breaks off during installation, during or immediately after the driving process, to leave only a smooth surface. It typically consists of a countersunk flat-head bolt, with a thin shank and hex head protruding from the flat head. The hex head is used to drive the bolt into the countersunk hole, then either a wrench or hammer is used to break the shank and hex head from the flat head, or it is driven until the driving head shears off. Either method leaves only a smooth bolt head exposed. This type of bolt is commonly used with prison door locks, automobile [[ignition switch]]es, and [[street sign]]s, to prevent easy removal. An alternative design leaves a low-profile button head visible after installation.&lt;ref name="TorkBolt" /&gt; In addition to breakaway bolts, breakaway nuts of similar design are available.&lt;ref name=TorkNut&gt;{{cite web|title=Tork-Nuts|url=http://www.losspreventionfasteners.com/store/products/tork-nut/|website=Loss Prevention Fasteners|publisher=Ultra Fasteners Inc.|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-security applications, a breakaway head fastener is sometimes used as a crude [[torque limiter]], intended to break off at an approximate torque limit. For example, certain [[toilet seat]] fastener bolts use a breakaway plastic nut, with the driver part intended to shear at a torque high enough to prevent wobbling, while not shattering the porcelain toilet from excessive pressure. Breakaway fasteners used in a non-security application may have a second driveable surface (such as a hex head) to allow later removal or adjustment of the fastener after the initial breakaway installation.

This drive type has the disadvantage of not being as precisely controlled as can be obtained by proper use of a [[torque wrench]]; applications may still fail due to either too little torque being applied to correctly fasten the joint, or too much torque being required to shear the head, resulting in damage to the material being fastened.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The '''Bristol''' (or '''Bristol spline''') screw drive is a fastener with four or six [[Rotating spline|splines]], but is not necessarily tamper resistant.&lt;ref name="USBNP"&gt;{{cite book |author=U.S. Bureau of Naval Personnel |year=1973 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvDpE5llCB8C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22bristol+wrench%22|title=Tools and Their Uses|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-22022-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grooves in the wrench are cut by a square-cornered [[broach (metalwork)|broach]], giving a slight [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercut]] to the outer corners of the driver. The main advantage to this drive system is that almost all of the turning force is applied at right angles to the fastener spline face, which reduces the possibility of stripping the fastener. For this reason Bristol screw drives are often used in softer, non-ferrous metals. Compared to an Allen drive, Bristol drives are less likely to strip for the same amount of torque; however, the Bristol drive is not much more strip-resistant than a Torx drive.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} It was created by the [[Bristol Wrench Company]].{{when|date=February 2017}}

This type of drive is commonly used in [[avionics]], higher-end communications equipment, cameras, air brakes, construction and farm equipment, astronomy equipment, and military equipment. Variants with a pin in the center are often found in game systems, to discourage improvised attempts to use a slotted screwdriver to drive the fastener.

The '''line''' screw drive is a Japanese system with male, female and female tamper-resistant screw configurations. The fasteners are commonly called "line head screws". They are also known as "game bit screws", due to their use on some video game consoles. They are found on IBM computers, as well as Nintendo and Sega systems and their [[ROM cartridge|game cartridge]]s. The female sizes are designated ALR2, ALR3, ALR4, ALR5, ALR6; the male sizes are designated with an "H" instead of an "R"; and the tamper-resistant female have a "T" at the end of the designation (e.g. ALR3T).&lt;ref name="sizes" /&gt;

In Japan, the male sizes are often designated as DTC-20, DTC-27, DTC-40 (discontinued) and DTC-45 corresponding to a respective screw head size of 3.2mm, 4.6mm, 6.4mm and 7.7mm; with the size of the screw measured across the widest portion of the mating part of the head. The most common sizes in use for consumer electronics are DCT-20 and DTC-27.

===One-way===
[[File:Screws - tamper resistant slotted.jpg|thumb|upright|A one-way slotted screw]]
[[File:Screw Head - One-way Clutch.svg|40px|left]]
'''One-way screws''' are special screws that can be turned only in one direction. They are sometimes called '''one-way clutch screws''', but should not be confused with [[#Clutch|true "clutch" screws]]. They can be installed with a standard flat-blade screwdriver, but cannot be easily removed using standard tools. One-way screws are commonly used in commercial restroom [[plumbing fixture|fixtures]] and on [[vehicle registration plate]]s, to prevent [[vandalism|vandals]] from tampering with them.

One-way screws are practical only when the need for removal is unlikely. They are difficult to remove with conventional tools because the slot is designed to cause [[cam out]] when even minimal torque is applied in the direction to unscrew it. Instead, a one-way screw can be removed by drilling a hole through the head of the screw and inserting a [[screw extractor]]. Alternatively, a [[rotary tool]] with cutting disk can be used to extend the slot, the head can be gripped with [[locking pliers]], or the screw can be removed with a pin spanner (snake-eyes driver) after drilling two holes in the slot. It can also sometimes be removed by attaching a precision drill chuck tight to the screw head, in a manner similar to removing screws that have broken heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Galloway |url=http://lifehacker.com/5979369/remove-screws-with-broken-heads-using-a-drill-chuck |title=Remove Screws with Broken Heads Using a Drill Chuck |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oval===
Jura espresso makers use a proprietary screw head with an eccentric oval to dissuade users from servicing their own machine, but the tool required (or just the bit for a common driver) is usually available from the same places that sell the parts directly to consumers.

===Pentalobe===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's first use of the pentalobe drive was in mid-2009 to secure the battery in the [[MacBook Pro]]. Smaller versions are now used on the [[iPhone 4]] and subsequent models, the [[MacBook Air]] (since the late 2010 model), the [[MacBook Pro]] with Retina Display and the [[MacBook (Retina)|2015 MacBook]]. Inexpensive pentalobe screwdrivers, manufactured by third parties, are relatively easy to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/24/apple_screws/ | title=The cost of beating Apple's shrewd screws? £2 | publisher=The Register | date=January 24, 2011 | accessdate=July 5, 2011 | author=Ray, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentalobe screw sizes include TS1 (also known as P2 or 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm, used on the iPhone 4 and subsequent models), TS4 (also known as P5 or 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm, used on the MacBook Air [since late 2010], the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and the 2015 MacBook) and TS5 (also known as P6 or 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm, used on the 2009 MacBook Pro battery). The TS designation is ambiguous as it is also used for a Torq-set screw drive.

  |publisher=Ribe Verbindungstechnik
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is spline-shaped with rounded ends in the fastener head. The tool has six flat teeth at equal spacing; the sizes are determined by the diameter of the star points. Its primary advantage over older screw drives is that it resists [[cam out]]. It is used primarily in the automotive industry in high-torque applications, such as [[brake]]s and [[driveshaft]]s.
{{clear left}}

===Proprietary head===
There are specialty fastener companies that make unusual, proprietary head designs, such as Slot-Lok and Avsafe.&lt;ref name="Avsafe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Avsafe|url=http://www.losspreventionfasteners.com/store/products/avsafe/|website=www.losspreventionfasteners.com|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These use special circular or oval cam-shaped heads that require complementary socket drivers.

For further security, there are custom-designed fastener heads requiring matching drivers available only from the manufacturer and only supplied to registered owners, similar to keyed locks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brycefastener.com/keyrex.htm|title=Key-Rex Security Screws|accessdate=2008-04-02|quote=The keyway is licensed and private for each user |dead-url=no |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060709053626/https://www.brycefastener.com/keyrex.htm |archivedate=2006-07-09}} ([https://www.brycefastener.com/key-rex-tamper-proof-screws-bolts.html Current KeyRex page])&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Ultra-Lok, and Ultra-Lok II are some of these designs that use custom keyed drivers, which tend to be confined to industrial and institutional uses that are unavailable to the average layperson. Key-Rex screws are another design, and are used in such things as ballot boxes and bank vaults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One example familiar to laypersons is for the attachment of wheels and spare tires of passenger vehicles to deter theft; one of the lug nuts on each wheel may require a specialized socket provided with the set of lug nuts. Similar security fasteners are also available for bicycle wheels and seats.

===Security hex===
{{Main|Hex key#Variants}}
[[File:Screw Head - Hex Socket Tamperproof.svg|left|frameless|40x40px]]
A '''security hex''' screw drive features an extruded pin to make the fastener more tamper resistant by inserting a pin in the fastener screw drive, requiring a tool with a corresponding hole to drive the fastener. This can also prevent attempts at turning the screw with a small flat-bladed screwdriver.{{clear left}}

===Security Torx===
{{Main|Torx#Variants}}
[[File:Screw Head - Torx Tamperproof.svg|left|frameless|40x40px]]
A '''security Torx''' screw drive is a common modification to socket and cruciform style drives to make the fastener more tamper resistant by inserting a pin in the fastener screw drive, requiring a tool with a corresponding hole to drive the fastener.

The driving tool is called a "spanner driver" or "spanner screwdriver"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=McMaster-Carr catalog|edition=116th |page=2821|url=http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/116/2821 | accessdate = 2011-09-26 | postscript =.|ref=harv}}&lt;sup&gt;Needs login&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, and a "pin spanner" in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} They are also often used for soft spikes on golf shoes.  The US military's M17 and M18 service pistols (variants of the Sig Sauer P320) use spanner screws to dissuade disassembly of the handgun beyond normal field maintenance except by the authorized armorer.

The knife and gun manufacturer Microtech uses a variation of this with 3 round holes arranged in a triangle shape. The camera company [[Leica Camera]] has used versions of this on rewind knobs and other levers on their [[rangefinder camera]]s.

===12-spline flange===
[[File:Screw Head - Spline.svg|40px|left]]
The '''12-spline flange screw''' drive has twelve [[spline (mechanical)|spline]]s in the fastener and tool. It consists of 12 equally spaced protrusions, each with a 60° angle. It is achieved overlaying 4 equilateral triangles, each one rotated 30° over the previous one. The spline drive was part of the obsolete, U.S-designed [[Optimum Metric Fastener System]] and was defined by [[ASTM International|ASTM]] B18.2.7.1M, which was withdrawn in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indfast.org/info/free-technical-info.asp?fld=Bulletins\Bulletin&amp;f=ISO%20Fastener%20Standards%20Should%20Be%20Used%20for%20All%20Metric%20Fasteners.pdf|title=ISO Fastener Standards Should Be Referenced for All Metric Fasteners|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the spline drive obsolescent.

===Torq-set===
[[File:Screw Head - Torq-set.svg|40px|left]]
[[File:TorqSet-Bits.jpg|thumb|A set of torq-set bits]]
'''Torq-set''' is a [[cruciform]] screw drive used in torque-sensitive applications. The Torq-set head is similar in appearance to a Phillips drive in that it has a cross with 4 arms. In Torq-set however, the lines are offset from each other, so they do not align to form intersecting slots across the top of the head. Because of this, a regular Phillips or flat-blade screwdriver will not fit the head. It is used in military and aerospace applications. For example the [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|E-3]], [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3]], [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], [[Airbus]], [[Embraer]], and [[Bombardier Inc.]]&lt;ref name=torqset&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillips-screw.com/torq-set.php |title=Phillips Screw Company |publisher=Phillips-screw.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips Screw Company owns the name and produces the fasteners.

The applicable standards that govern the Torq-set geometry are National Aerospace Standard NASM 33781 and NASM 14191 for the ribbed version. The ribbed version is also known as ACR Torq-set.&lt;ref name="acr_torq-set"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillips-screw.com/acr_torq-set.php |title=Phillips Screw Company |publisher=Phillips-screw.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tri-angle===
[[File:Screw Head - TA.svg|40px|left]]
The '''TA''' is a type of screw drive that uses a triangle-shaped recess in the screw head. This drive can restrict access to the device internals but can readily be driven with hex keys. These screws are often found in children's toys from fast food restaurants, as well as vacuum cleaners, fan heaters, [[elevator]]s, camping stoves, golf clubs, Breville kettles and Master Locks, among others, Sizes include TA14, TA18, TA20, TA23 and TA27.&lt;ref name="Triang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sizes.com/tools/screw_drive.htm#Triangular|title=Triangular recesses and heads|website=Screw drive systems|language=en|accessdate=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the sides of the triangle are straight, which differs from Tri-point-3 fasteners.{{clear left}}

[[File:Screw Head - TP3.svg|40px|left]]
'''TP3''' (sometimes referred to as '''tri-lobe''' or '''tri-lobular''') uses a [[Reuleaux triangle]]-shaped recess in the screw head, to make it semi-secure because it cannot be driven by a flat-blade screwdriver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamperproof.com/categories/tp3-security-to-the-third-power.html|title=TP3|accessdate=2009-05-23|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not readily driven, as Tri-angle is, by hex keys. It is used on [[fast food]] promotional toys and video games, die-cast toys, and some [[Roomba]] battery packs. There are four sizes: ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;mm, 2.3&amp;nbsp;mm, 2.7&amp;nbsp;mm, and 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm.

===Tri-wing===
[[File:Screw Head - Tri-wing.svg|40px|left]]
The '''tri-wing''', also known as '''triangular slotted''', is a screw with three slotted "wings" and a small triangular hole in the center. Unlike the "tri-point" fastener, the slots are offset, and do not intersect the center of the fastener. A version with left-hand threads is called an '''Opsit''' screw, where unscrewing can be done by turning the screwdriver clockwise, which is the opposite of tri-wing and regular screws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tri-Wing Screwdriver |url=http://www.triwingscrewdrivers.com/types/ |title=Tri-wing screwdriver: Types |publisher=Triwingscrewdrivers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opsit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Fasteners|url=http://www.stanleyfasteners.com/catalog/ch6/ch6-4.html|website=www.stanleyfasteners.com|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was adopted by some parts of the aerospace industry, led by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in the early 1970s on the [[L-1011]], but met with mixed results due to complaints of insert damage during installation.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[McDonnell Douglas]] also used this as a primary fastener on its commercial aircraft. British Aerospace and Airbus are also users of this fastener. In the present day it is usually seen on electronics equipment.

==Other drive types==

=== U-drive ===
A U-drive screw has a helical thread with an angle acute enough to be driven by a hammer, and thus has a domed head with no means of turning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastenersuperstore.com/fastener-guides/screws-drive-styles-guide|title=Fastener Superstore Fastener Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are most frequently driven into plastic.

[[File:Screws.jpg|thumb|right|260px|An assortment of screws]]
[[File:BOLT SCREW UBT 198.JPG|thumb|260px|A bolt and a screw]]
A '''screw''' is a type of [[fastener]], in some ways similar to a [[Bolt (fastener)|bolt]] (see ''[[Screw#Differentiation between bolt and screw|Differentiation between bolt and screw]]'' below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a [[helix|helical]] ridge, known as a ''male thread'' (external thread). Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that may help pull fastened materials together and  prevent pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; those commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.

==Explanation==
A screw is a combination of [[simple machines]]—it is in essence an [[inclined plane]] wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge in the form of the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a ''female thread'' (internal thread), often in the form of a nut, or object that has the internal thread formed into it.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.

[[File:Wood screw with legend.svg|thumb|A wood screw: a) head; b) not threaded shank; c) threaded shank; d) tip.]]

A screw will usually have a ''head'' on one end that contains a specially formed shape that allows it to be turned, or ''driven'', with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include [[screwdriver]]s and [[wrench]]es. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a ''[[bearing surface]]''. There are exceptions; for instance, carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven; [[set screw]]s often have a head smaller than the outer [[diameter]] of the screw; J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the ''shank''; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1990|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The distance between each thread is called the "pitch".

The majority of screws are tightened by [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]] rotation, which is termed a ''right-hand thread''; a common [[mnemonic device]] for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey". If the fingers of the right hand are curled around a right-hand thread, it will move in the direction of the thumb when turned in the same direction as the fingers are curled.  Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases, where loads would tend to loosen a right handed fastener, or when non-interchangeability with right-hand fasteners is required. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side [[Bicycle pedal#Attachment|pedal]] of a [[bicycle]] has a left-hand thread.

More generally, screw may mean any helical device, such as a clamp, a [[micrometer]], a ship's [[propeller]], or an [[Archimedes' screw]] water pump.

==Differentiation between bolt and screw==
[[File:Bolt (PSF).png|thumb|A carriage bolt with a square nut]]
[[File:DIN6914 UNI5587.jpg|thumb|upright|A structural bolt with a hex nut and washer]]

There is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw ''screws into something'', a bolt ''bolts several things together''). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of "screws" nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'' describes the distinction as follows:

{{quote|A bolt is an externally threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an externally threaded fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An externally threaded fastener which is prevented from being turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head bolts, track bolts, plow bolts.) An externally threaded fastener that has thread form which prohibits assembly with a nut having a straight thread of multiple pitch length is a screw. (Example: wood screws, tapping screws.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1492}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This distinction is consistent with [[ASME|ASME B18.2.1]] and some dictionary definitions for ''screw''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cambridge Dictionary of American English | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=screw*1+0&amp;dict=A | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = allwords | url = http://www.allwords.com/query.php?SearchType=3&amp;Keyword=screw&amp;goquery=Find+it%21&amp;Language=ENG | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''bolt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Merriam Webster Dictionary bolt | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolt | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Compact Oxford English Dictionary bolt | publisher = Oxford | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/bolt_1?view=uk | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary bolt | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=8680&amp;dict=CALD | accessdate = 2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fastener Resource Center - Know your Bolts|url=http://www.fastenerexperts.com/bolt-guide/ |accessdate = 2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2013}} Some of these issues are discussed below:

=== Wood screws ===
Early wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wag-aic.org/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf|title=Observations on the Development of Wood Screws in North America|last=White|first=Christopher|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 1850s [[swaging]] tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread. Screws made with these tools have rounded valleys with sharp and rough threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanlongrifles.org/forum/index.php?topic=18831.0|title=Making 18th c wood screws|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UIxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA12|title=Iron Age, Volume 44|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some wood screws were made with cutting dies as early as the late 1700s (possibly even before 1678 when the book content was first published in parts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mechanic Exercises: Or the Doctrine of Handy-Works|last=Moxon|first=Joseph|publisher=|year=1703|isbn=|location=Mendham, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once screw turning machines were in common use, most commercially available wood screws were produced with this method. These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.

=== Machine screws ===
ASME standards specify a variety of "Machine Screws"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=1568–1598}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in diameters ranging up to {{convert|0.75|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}.  These fasteners are often used with nuts but also often driven into [[tapped hole]]s (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.

=== Hex cap screws ===
ASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is {{convert|0.25|–|3|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} in [[diameter]]. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  ''Machinery's Handbook'' refers parenthetically to these fasteners as "Finished Hex Bolts".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1496}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document ''Distinguishing Bolts from Screws'', the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Distinguishing Bolts from Screws page 7 |url= https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Apr/icp013_3.pdf |accessdate= 2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|title=National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST|website=NIST|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055941/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/fqaregs2.cfm|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fastener Quality Act" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PrintBook/B1821_1996_Square_Hex_Bolts.cfm B18.2.1 - 1996 Square and Hex Bolts and Screws, Inch Series - Print-Book&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was re-written and as a result they eliminated the "Finished Hex Bolts" and renamed them the "Hex Cap Screw"—a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.

=== Lug bolts and head bolts ===
These terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction they would be screws.  Here common terms are at variance with ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=autorepair.com Glossary - lug bolt|url=http://autorepair.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-900.htm|accessdate = 2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=autozone.com Glossary - head bolt|url=http://www.autozone.com/autozone/repairinfo/common/repairInfoMain.jsp?leftNavPage=glossary&amp;startLetter=h&amp;targetPage=glossarySelected|accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lag screw ===
&lt;!-- [[Lag screw]] redirects here. --&gt;
[[File:Lag screws aka lag bolts 001.png|thumb|upright|Lag screws, also called lag bolts]]

'''Lag screws''' (US) or '''coach screws''' (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also referred to as '''lag bolts''' or '''coach bolts''', although this is a [[misnomer]]) are large wood screws. Square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from {{convert|1/4|to|1+1/4|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}, and lengths from {{convert|1/4|to|6|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).

The materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc [[galvanization]] (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray [[hot-dip galvanizing|hot-dip galvanized]]. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier ''lag'' came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of [[wikt:lag#Noun|lag]]s such as barrel staves and other similar parts.&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These fasteners are "screws" according to the ''Machinery's Handbook'' criteria, and the obsolescent term "lag bolt" has been replaced by "lag screw" in the ''Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|p=1497}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to many tradesmen, they are "bolts", because they are large, with hex or square heads.

=== United States government standards ===
The [[federal government of the United States]] made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different [[tariff]]s apply to each.&lt;ref name="CBP.gov_bolts-vs-screws"&gt;{{Citation |author=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) |authorlink=U.S. Customs and Border Protection  |date=July 2012 |title=What Every Member of the Trade Community Should Know About: Distinguishing Bolts from Screws |series=An Informed Compliance Publication |edition=2011-02 |publisher=CBP.gov |location=Washington, D.C., USA |pages= |url=http://www.cbp.gov/document/publications/distinguishing-bolts-screws |doi= |id= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms "coarse" and "fine" to refer to the tightness of the [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] range, referring basically to "high-quality" or "low-quality", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to [[Screw thread#Coarse versus fine|the steepness of the helix's lead]]).

=== Historical issue ===
Old [[United States Standard|USS]] and [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded.&lt;ref name="dyke"&gt;{{Citation|title=Dyke's Automobile and Gasoline Engine Encyclopedia page 701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqI7AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA702&amp;lpg=RA1-PA702&amp;dq=sae+uss+screw+standard|accessdate = 2009-01-13|postscript=. | year=1919 | publisher=A.L. Dyke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the ''grip'', was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.

Although there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that "a bolt by definition takes a nut". Using a coach "bolt" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.

=== Controlled vocabulary versus natural language ===
The distinctions above are enforced in the [[controlled vocabulary]] of [[standards organization]]s. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the [[natural language]] use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the [[History of technology|changing of technology over centuries]]. The words ''bolt'' and ''screw'' have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved [[retronym]]ously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word ''screw'' has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw [[gimlet (tool)|gimlet]] (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.

The word ''bolt'' is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the [[crossbow]] bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called ''screw bolts'' in contradistinction to [[Clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|''clench bolts'']].

In common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, [[cylinder head]] bolts are called "bolts" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called "screws". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this [[natural language|natural]] word choice proclivity.

====Other distinctions====
Bolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as [[ISO metric screw thread]] M, MJ, [[Unified Thread Standard]] UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- See the talk page. --&gt; These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the ''Machinery's handbook'' distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.

A possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.
On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.

==Types of screws and bolts==
Threaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.

Lag bolts are designed for securely fastening heavy timbers ([[Timber framing|post and beams]], timber railway trestles and bridges) to one another, or to fasten wood to masonry or concrete. The German standard is DIN 571, Hexagon head wood screws.

Lag bolts are usually used with an expanding insert called a lag in masonry or concrete walls, the lag manufactured with a hard metal jacket that bites into the sides of the drilled hole, and the inner metal in the lag being a softer alloy of lead, or zinc alloyed with soft iron.

Wood screws are commonly available with flat, pan or oval-heads. A wood screw generally has a partially unthreaded shank below the head. The unthreaded portion of the shank is designed to slide through the top board (closest to the screw head) so that it can be pulled tight to the board to which it is being attached. Inch-sized wood screws in the U.S. are defined by ANSI-B18.6.1-1981(R2003), while in Germany they are defined by DIN 95 (Slotted raised countersunk (oval) head wood screws), DIN 96 (Slotted round head wood screws), and DIN 97 (Slotted countersunk (flat) head wood screws).

Currently, it most narrowly refers to a style of head (see the gallery below). More broadly, and more commonly, it refers to the group of screws: shoulder screws, hex heads, counter-sunk heads, button heads, and fillister heads.

A socket cap screw, also known as a ''socket head capscrew'', ''socket screw'', or ''Allen bolt'', is a type of cap screw with a cylindrical head and hexagonal drive hole.  The term ''socket head capscrew'' typically refers to a type of threaded fastener whose head diameter is [[Real versus nominal value|nominally]] 1.5 times that of the screw shank ([[major diameter|major]]) diameter, with a head height equal to the shank diameter (1960 series design). [[forging|Forged]] [[heat treat|heat-treated]] [[alloy]] examples are high strength fasteners intended for the most demanding mechanical applications, with special alloy formulations available that are capable of maintaining strength at temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees F (587 degrees C).

In addition to the 1960 series design, other head designs include low head, button head and flat head, the latter designed to be seated into [[countersink|countersunk]] holes.  A [[hex key]] (sometimes referred to as an ''Allen wrench'' or ''Allen key'') or ''[[hex driver]]'' is required to tighten or loosen a socket screw. Socket head capscrews are commonly used in assemblies that do not provide sufficient clearance for a conventional wrench or [[socket wrench|socket]].

|-
| || shoulder bolt&lt;br /&gt;shoulder screw || stripper bolt || A shoulder screw differs from machine screws in that the shank is held to a precise diameter, known as the ''shoulder'', and the threaded portion is smaller in diameter than the shoulder. Shoulder screw specifications call out the shoulder diameter, shoulder length, and threaded diameter; the threaded length is fixed, based on the threaded diameter, and usually quite short. Shoulder screws can be manufactured in many materials such as [[alloy]] [[heat treat|heat-treated]] [[steel]] for maximum strength and wear resistance and stainless steel for its corrosion-resistance and non-magnetic properties. Common applications for shoulder screws include rotating [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism joints]], [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage pivots]], and guides for the [[stripper plate]] of a [[die (manufacturing)|metal forming die]] set.  In the latter application, the term stripper bolt is often substituted. Stainless steel shoulder screws are used with linear motion devices such as bearings, as guides and as pivots in electronic and other critical mechanical applications.

|-
| || tension control bolt || || A tension control bolt (TC bolt) is a heavy duty bolt used in steel frame construction. The head is usually domed and is not designed to be driven. The end of the shank has a spline on it which is engaged by a special power wrench which prevents the bolt from turning while the nut is tightened. When the appropriate torque is reached the spline shears off.
|-
| || thread rolling screws ||  || These have a lobed (usually triangular) cross-section. They form threads in a pre-existing hole in the mating workpiece by pushing the material outward during installation. In some cases the properly prepared hole in sheetmetal uses an extruded hole. The extrusion forms a lead-in and extra thread length for improved retention. Thread rolling screws are often used where loose chips formed by a thread cutting operation cannot be tolerated.

===Fasteners with built in washers===
A fastener with a built in [[Washer (hardware)|washer]] is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-as'''SEM'''bled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Screws|url=http://www.elexp.com/tips/AllAboutScrews.pdf|publisher=Curious Inventor|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/glossary.htm#s|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.

===Other threaded fasteners===

==== Superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner ====
A superbolt, or [[multi-jackbolt tensioner]] is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.

====Bone screws====
{{Main article|internal fixation}}
The field of screws and other hardware for [[internal fixation]] within the body is huge and diverse. Like [[prosthesis|prosthetics]], it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as [[machining]], [[CAD/CAM]], and [[3D printing]]) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary [[list of screw drives|screw drive]] types (some not seen outside of these applications).

===List of abbreviations for types of screws===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
These abbreviations have [[jargon]] currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, if you know that "FH" means "flat head", then you may be able to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing "FH".

These abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.

The extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.

==Materials==
Screws and bolts are usually made of [[steel]]. 
Where great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[brass]], [[titanium]], [[bronze]], silicon bronze or monel may be used.

[[Galvanic corrosion]] of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using [[aluminium|aluminum]] screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. 
Some types of plastic, such as [[nylon]] or [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical [[Electrical insulation|insulation]].

Often a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. [[japanning]]) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.

Selection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.

==Bolted joints==
[[File:Rustybolt th.jpg|thumb|right|Rusty hexagonal bolt heads]]
{{Main article|Bolted joint}}

The [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] ([[AISC]]) 13th Edition Steel Design Manual section 16.1 chapter J-3 specifies the requirements for bolted structural connections. Structural bolts replaced rivets due to the decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the "faying" surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction is proportional to the normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second (and more common type) of connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection, the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a "snug-fit". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections. Bearing type connections are used in lightweight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common bearing type connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.

==Mechanical classifications==&lt;!-- [[Property class]] &amp; [[Grade (fasteners)]] redirect here --&gt;
The numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] strength rating (called ''property class'') stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the [[ultimate tensile strength]] in [[megapascal|MPa]] divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.

Ultimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% [[yield strength#Definition|offset strain]]. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brenner|first1=Harry S.|editor1-last=Parmley|editor1-first=Robert O.|title=Standard Handbook of Fastening and Joining|date=1977|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-048511-9|page=Chapter 1 page 10|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.

Mild steel bolts have property class 4.6, with is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.

The same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.chiltondiy.com/2013/12/how-to-recognize-metric-and-sae-bolts-2/ How to Recognize Metric and SAE Bolts]", Chilton DIY, Retrieved April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, low-cost [[counterfeit]] fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://standards.sae.org/wip/as6496/ Fraudulent/Counterfeit Electronic Parts]", SAE International, Retrieved April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many standards governing the material and mechanical properties of imperial sized externally threaded fasteners.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from carbon steels are ASTM A193, ASTM A307, ASTM A354, ASTM F3125, and SAE J429.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from corrosion resistant steels are ASTM F593 &amp; ASTM A193.

Some varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle [[steering column]]s, to secure the [[ignition switch]].

{{Screw drives|screw}}
{{Main article|List of screw drives}}

Modern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.

==Tools==
[[File:Screw-into-wood.ogg|left|180px|thumb|An electric driver screws a self-tapping phillips head screw into wood]]

The hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a ''[[screwdriver]]''. A power tool that does the same job is a ''power screwdriver''; [[power drill]]s may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and ''torque-limiting screwdrivers'' are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a ''spanner'' (UK usage) or ''wrench'' (US usage), while a ''nut setter'' is used with a power screw driver.

==Thread standards==
{{Contradicts other|date=February 2010|1=Screw thread}}
{{Main article|Screw thread}}

There are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the [[ISO metric screw thread]] preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the [[British Standard Whitworth]], [[British Association screw threads|BA system (British Association)]], and the [[Unified Thread Standard]].

===ISO metric screw thread===
{{Main article|ISO metric screw thread}}

The basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in [[international standard]] [[ISO 68-1]] and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in [[ISO 262]]. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the ''coarse pitch''. For some diameters, one or two additional ''fine pitch'' variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter '''M''' followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g. ''M8''). If the thread does not use the normal ''coarse pitch'' (e.g. 1.25&amp;nbsp;mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a [[multiplication sign]] (e.g. "M8×1" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8&amp;nbsp;mm and advances by 1&amp;nbsp;mm per 360° rotation).

The nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1&amp;nbsp;mm, is made by threading a 6&amp;nbsp;mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter (6&amp;nbsp;mm - 1&amp;nbsp;mm).

Metric [[hexagon]] bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in [[British Standard]] BS&amp;nbsp;4190 (general purpose screws) and BS&amp;nbsp;3692 (precision screws). The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximal width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:right"

|}

In addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:right"

|11||22||27||32||41||50||60||70||80||90||100
|}

===Whitworth===
{{Main article|British Standard Whitworth}}

The first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the [[England|English]] [[engineer]] Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became ''British Standard Whitworth'', abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the ''British Standard Fine'' (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The [[thread angle]] was 55°, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.

The most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK [[scaffolding]]. Additionally, the standard photographic [[tripod (photography)|tripod]] thread, which for small cameras is 1/4" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with "thread adapters" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4" [[Unified National Coarse|UNC]] bolts fit 1/4" BSW camera tripod bushes, [[yield strength]] is reduced by the different thread angles of 60° and 55° respectively.

===British Association screw thread===
{{Main article|British Association screw threads}}

British Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as "2BA", "4BA" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order—it may be suspected—to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 "Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A."

While not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and 1&amp;nbsp;mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p=0.9^4&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;mm (0.65mm) and diameter &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 6p^{1.2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;mm (3.62mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.

BA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.

BA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.threadcheck.com/technical-documents/thread-systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unified Thread Standard===
{{Main article|Unified Thread Standard}}

The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the [[United States]], but is also extensively used in [[Canada]] and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: '''X-Y''', where '''X''' is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and '''Y''' is the [[threads per inch]] (TPI). For sizes {{frac|1|4}} inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an [[integer]] is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + (0.013 &amp;times; number).  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + (0.013 &amp;times; 4) = 0.060 + 0.052 = 0.112&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than "0" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought – seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of "ought" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by 0.013 and subtract from 0.060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 – (3 x .013) = 0.060 - 0.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp97-99" /&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Bolt Forming.svg|thumb|300px]]
[[File:Screw (bolt) 13-n.PNG|thumb]]
{{see also|Threading (manufacturing)}}

There are three steps in manufacturing a screw: ''heading'', ''thread rolling'', and ''coating''. Screws are normally made from [[wire]], which is supplied in large coils, or round [[bar stock]] for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a ''blank''. It is then [[heading (metalworking)|cold headed]], which is a [[cold working]] process. Heading produces the ''head'' of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a ''slotting machine''. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.
&lt;!--
The process works as follows: the bar stock is fed into a machine, called a "former". The bar stock is stopped, and then gripped by a gripping [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. The gripping die is shaped in such a way that it forms a carriage along the neck of the stock when its full gripping force is applied. An indented [[Punch (engineering)|punch]], the shape of a rounded head, will then proceed to move forward, colliding with the stock and causing the metal to flow at right angles to the ram force provided by the punch, increasing the diameter of the workpiece, and reducing its overall length, thus forming a "rounded" head. The work billet is then [[Shearing (manufacturing)|shear]]ed to the desired length. ---A ref needs to be found for all this, because the first paragraph states that blanks are made then formed and the second states that the shank and heading occur first then its cut to length. Wizard191--&gt;

The blanks are then polished{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!-- It seems more logical that the author meant "clean" and/or "degrease" because polishing is expensive and seemingly unnecessary. --&gt; again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via [[thread rolling]]; however, some are [[thread cutting|cut]]. The workpiece is then [[tumble finishing|tumble finished]] with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} For most screws, a coating, such as [[electroplating]] with zinc ([[galvanizing]]) or applying [[black oxide]], is applied to prevent corrosion.

==History==
[[File:Screw making machine, 1871.png|thumb|right|A [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] of 1871, equipped with [[leadscrew]] and change gears for single-point screw-cutting.]]
[[File:Brownie-4slide.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]] single-[[Spindle (tool)|spindle]] screw machine.]]

While a recent hypothesis attributes the [[Archimedes' screw]] to [[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]], archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the [[Hellenistic period]] and the standard view holds the device to be a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]] and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003). "Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World", ''Technology and Culture'' '''44''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2010}}  Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.

Earlier, the screw had been described by the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archytas|Archytas of Tarentum]] (428–350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] world in [[screw press]]es for pressing [[olive oil]] from olives and pressing juice from grapes in [[winemaking]]. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{Citation | title = Am_Wood_Screws | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/wag/Am_Wood_Screws.pdf | accessdate = 2010-04-30 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rybczynski has shown&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp34,66,90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=34, 66, 90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that handheld [[screwdriver]]s (formerly called "turnscrews" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, ''tournevis''&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp32-36,44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=32–36, 44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.{{peacock term|date=June 2016}}

There were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as [[dowel]]s and pins, wedging, [[mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]], [[dovetail joint|dovetails]], [[nail (fastener)|nailing]] (with or without clenching the nail ends), [[forge welding]], and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of [[knot]]s. Prior to the mid-19th century, [[Split pin|cotter pins]] or [[clinker (boat building)#Fastening the centre-line structure|pin bolts]], and "clinch bolts" (now called [[Rivet#Types|rivet]]s), were used in shipbuilding. [[Adhesive|Glues]] also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.

The metal screw did not become a common fastener until [[machine tool]]s for their [[mass production]] were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp75-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=75–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; along two separate paths that soon [[technological convergence|converged]]:&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the mass production of ''wood'' screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, [[toolroom]]-style production of ''machine'' screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).

The first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of [[Staffordshire]], UK,&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a [[Automatic lathe#Screw machine|screw machine]] of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch,&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p75"/&gt; and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p75"/&gt; Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.

Meanwhile, English instrument maker [[Jesse Ramsden]] (1735–1800) was working on the [[tool and die maker|toolmaking]] and [[:Category:Scientific instrument makers|instrument-making]] end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory [[screw-cutting lathe]].&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp97-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=97–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British engineer [[Henry Maudslay]] (1771–1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring [[commodification]]. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of [[James Nasmyth]] popularized the notion that Maudslay had ''invented'' the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.

These developments of the 1760–1800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. [[Screw thread#History of standardization|Standardization of threadforms]] began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push [[unit price]]s lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp76-78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=76–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American development of the [[turret lathe]] (1840s) and of automatic [[automatic lathe#Screw machine|screw machines]]  derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This [[demand curve|cost reduction spurred ever greater use]] of screws.

Throughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, [[List of screw drives|drive types]]) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to [[Machining|machine]] and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s,&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp79-81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|pp=79–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian [[P. L. Robertson]] was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal [[cold forming]] as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000pp79-81"/&gt; Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive ([[hex key|hex socket]]) shortly followed in 1911.&lt;ref name="US_patent_161390"&gt;{{US patent|161,390}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallowell1951pp51-59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallowell|1951|pp=51–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, the popular Phillips-head screw was invented by American [[Henry F. Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

Threadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.

Precision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski2000p104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybczynski|2000|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They are key components of micrometers and lathes.
